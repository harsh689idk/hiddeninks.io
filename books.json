      " In Moulmein, in lower Burma, I was hated by large numbers of people – the only time in my life that I have been important enough for this to happen to me. I was sub-divisional police officer of the town, and in an aimless, petty kind of way anti-European feeling was very bitter. No one had the guts to raise a riot, but if a European woman went through the bazaars alone somebody would probably spit betel juice over her dress. As a police officer I was an obvious target and was baited whenever it seemed safe to do so. When a nimble Burman tripped me up on the football field and the referee (another Burman) looked the other way, the crowd yelled with hideous laughter. This happened more than once. In the end the sneering yellow faces of young men that met me everywhere, the insults hooted after me when I was at a safe distance, got badly on my nerves. The young Buddhist priests were the worst of all. There were several thousands of them in the town and none of them seemed to have anything to do except stand on street corners and jeer at Europeans. ",
      "All this was perplexing and upsetting. For at that time I had already made up my mind that imperialism was an evil thing and the sooner I chucked up my job and got out of it the better. Theoretically – and secretly, of course – I was all for the Burmese and all against their oppressors, the British. As for the job I was doing, I hated it more bitterly than I can perhaps make clear. In a job like that you see the dirty work of Empire at close quarters. The wretched prisoners huddling in the stinking cages of the lock-ups, the grey, cowed faces of the long-term convicts, the scarred buttocks of the men who had been Bogged with bamboos – all these oppressed me with an intolerable sense of guilt. But I could get nothing into perspective. I was young and ill-educated and I had had to think out my problems in the utter silence that is imposed on every Englishman in the East. I did not even know that the British Empire is dying, still less did I know that it is a great deal better than the younger empires that are going to supplant it. All I knew was that I was stuck between my hatred of the empire I served and my rage against the evil-spirited little beasts who tried to make my job impossible. With one part of my mind I thought of the British Raj as an unbreakable tyranny, as something clamped down, in saecula saeculorum, upon the will of prostrate peoples; with another part I thought that the greatest joy in the world would be to drive a bayonet into a Buddhist priest’s guts. Feelings like these are the normal by-products of imperialism; ask any Anglo-Indian official, if you can catch him off duty. ",
      "One day something happened which in a roundabout way was enlightening. It was a tiny incident in itself, but it gave me a better glimpse than I had had before of the real nature of imperialism – the real motives for which despotic governments act. Early one morning the sub-inspector at a police station the other end of the town rang me up on the phone and said that an elephant was ravaging the bazaar. Would I please come and do something about it? I did not know what I could do, but I wanted to see what was happening and I got on to a pony and started out. I took my rifle, an old 44 Winchester and much too small to kill an elephant, but I thought the noise might be useful in terrorem. Various Burmans stopped me on the way and told me about the elephant’s doings. It was not, of course, a wild elephant, but a tame one which had gone “must.” It had been chained up, as tame elephants always are when their attack of “must” is due, but on the previous night it had broken its chain and escaped. Its mahout, the only person who could manage it when it was in that state, had set out in pursuit, but had taken the wrong direction and was now twelve hours’ journey away, and in the morning the elephant had suddenly reappeared in the town. The Burmese population had no weapons and were quite helpless against it. It had already destroyed somebody’s bamboo hut, killed a cow and raided some fruit-stalls and devoured the stock; also it had met the municipal rubbish van and, when the driver jumped out and took to his heels, had turned the van over and inflicted violences upon it. ",
      "The Burmese sub-inspector and some Indian constables were waiting for me in the quarter where the elephant had been seen. It was a very poor quarter, a labyrinth of squalid bamboo huts, thatched with palmleaf, winding all over a steep hillside. I remember that it was a cloudy, stuffy morning at the beginning of the rains. We began questioning the people as to where the elephant had gone and, as usual, failed to get any definite information. That is invariably the case in the East; a story always sounds clear enough at a distance, but the nearer you get to the scene of events the vaguer it becomes. Some of the people said that the elephant had gone in one direction, some said that he had gone in another, some professed not even to have heard of any elephant. I had almost made up my mind that the whole story was a pack of lies, when we heard yells a little distance away. There was a loud, scandalized cry of “Go away, child! Go away this instant!” and an old woman with a switch in her hand came round the corner of a hut, violently shooing away a crowd of naked children. Some more women followed, clicking their tongues and exclaiming; evidently there was something that the children ought not to have seen. I rounded the hut and saw a man’s dead body sprawling in the mud. He was an Indian, a black Dravidian coolie, almost naked, and he could not have been dead many minutes. The people said that the elephant had come suddenly upon him round the corner of the hut, caught him with its trunk, put its foot on his back and ground him into the earth. This was the rainy season and the ground was soft, and his face had scored a trench a foot deep and a couple of yards long. He was lying on his belly with arms crucified and head sharply twisted to one side. His face was coated with mud, the eyes wide open, the teeth bared and grinning with an expression of unendurable agony. (Never tell me, by the way, that the dead look peaceful. Most of the corpses I have seen looked devilish.) The friction of the great beast’s foot had stripped the skin from his back as neatly as one skins a rabbit. As soon as I saw the dead man I sent an orderly to a friend’s house nearby to borrow an elephant rifle. I had already sent back the pony, not wanting it to go mad with fright and throw me if it smelt the elephant. ",
      "The orderly came back in a few minutes with a rifle and five cartridges, and meanwhile some Burmans had arrived and told us that the elephant was in the paddy fields below, only a few hundred yards away. As I started forward practically the whole population of the quarter flocked out of the houses and followed me. They had seen the rifle and were all shouting excitedly that I was going to shoot the elephant. They had not shown much interest in the elephant when he was merely ravaging their homes, but it was different now that he was going to be shot. It was a bit of fun to them, as it would be to an English crowd; besides they wanted the meat. It made me vaguely uneasy. I had no intention of shooting the elephant – I had merely sent for the rifle to defend myself if necessary – and it is always unnerving to have a crowd following you. I marched down the hill, looking and feeling a fool, with the rifle over my shoulder and an evergrowing army of people jostling at my heels. At the bottom, when you got away from the huts, there was a metalled road and beyond that a miry waste of paddy fields a thousand yards across, not yet ploughed but soggy from the first rains and dotted with coarse grass. The elephant was standing eight yards from the road, his left side towards us. He took not the slightest notice of the crowd’s approach. He was tearing up bunches of grass, beating them against his knees to clean them and stuffing them into his mouth. ",
      "I had halted on the road. As soon as I saw the elephant I knew with perfect certainty that I ought not to shoot him. It is a serious matter to shoot a working elephant – it is comparable to destroying a huge and costly piece of machinery – and obviously one ought not to do it if it can possibly be avoided. And at that distance, peacefully eating, the elephant looked no more dangerous than a cow. I thought then and I think now that his attack of “must” was already passing off; in which case he would merely wander harmlessly about until the mahout came back and caught him. Moreover, I did not in the least want to shoot him. I decided that I would watch him for a little while to make sure that he did not turn savage again, and then go home. ",
      "But at that moment I glanced round at the crowd that had followed me. It was an immense crowd, two thousand at the least and growing every minute. It blocked the road for a long distance on either side. I looked at the sea of yellow faces above the garish clothes-faces all happy and excited over this bit of fun, all certain that the elephant was going to be shot. They were watching me as they would watch a conjurer about to perform a trick. They did not like me, but with the magical rifle in my hands I was momentarily worth watching. And suddenly I realized that I should have to shoot the elephant after all. The people expected it of me and I had got to do it; I could feel their two thousand wills pressing me forward, irresistibly. And it was at this moment, as I stood there with the rifle in my hands, that I first grasped the hollowness, the futility of the white man’s dominion in the East. Here was I, the white man with his gun, standing in front of the unarmed native crowd – seemingly the leading actor of the piece; but in reality I was only an absurd puppet pushed to and fro by the will of those yellow faces behind. I perceived in this moment that when the white man turns tyrant it is his own freedom that he destroys. He becomes a sort of hollow, posing dummy, the conventionalized figure of a sahib. For it is the condition of his rule that he shall spend his life in trying to impress the “natives,” and so in every crisis he has got to do what the “natives” expect of him. He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it. I had got to shoot the elephant. I had committed myself to doing it when I sent for the rifle. A sahib has got to act like a sahib; he has got to appear resolute, to know his own mind and do definite things. To come all that way, rifle in hand, with two thousand people marching at my heels, and then to trail feebly away, having done nothing – no, that was impossible. The crowd would laugh at me. And my whole life, every white man’s life in the East, was one long struggle not to be laughed at. ",
      "But I did not want to shoot the elephant. I watched him beating his bunch of grass against his knees, with that preoccupied grandmotherly air that elephants have. It seemed to me that it would be murder to shoot him. At that age I was not squeamish about killing animals, but I had never shot an elephant and never wanted to. (Somehow it always seems worse to kill a large animal. Besides, there was the beast’s owner to be considered. Alive, the elephant was worth at least a hundred pounds; dead, he would only be worth the value of his tusks, five pounds, possibly. But I had got to act quickly. I turned to some experienced-looking Burmans who had been there when we arrived, and asked them how the elephant had been behaving. They all said the same thing: he took no notice of you if you left him alone, but he might charge if you went too close to him.",
      "It was perfectly clear to me what I ought to do. I ought to walk up to within, say, twenty-five yards of the elephant and test his behavior. If he charged, I could shoot; if he took no notice of me, it would be safe to leave him until the mahout came back. But also I knew that I was going to do no such thing. I was a poor shot with a rifle and the ground was soft mud into which one would sink at every step. If the elephant charged and I missed him, I should have about as much chance as a toad under a steam-roller. But even then I was not thinking particularly of my own skin, only of the watchful yellow faces behind. For at that moment, with the crowd watching me, I was not afraid in the ordinary sense, as I would have been if I had been alone. A white man mustn’t be frightened in front of “natives”; and so, in general, he isn’t frightened. The sole thought in my mind was that if anything went wrong those two thousand Burmans would see me pursued, caught, trampled on and reduced to a grinning corpse like that Indian up the hill. And if that happened it was quite probable that some of them would laugh. That would never do. ",
      "There was only one alternative. I shoved the cartridges into the magazine and lay down on the road to get a better aim. The crowd grew very still, and a deep, low, happy sigh, as of people who see the theatre curtain go up at last, breathed from innumerable throats. They were going to have their bit of fun after all. The rifle was a beautiful German thing with cross-hair sights. I did not then know that in shooting an elephant one would shoot to cut an imaginary bar running from ear-hole to ear-hole. I ought, therefore, as the elephant was sideways on, to have aimed straight at his ear-hole, actually I aimed several inches in front of this, thinking the brain would be further forward. ",
      "When I pulled the trigger I did not hear the bang or feel the kick – one never does when a shot goes home – but I heard the devilish roar of glee that went up from the crowd. In that instant, in too short a time, one would have thought, even for the bullet to get there, a mysterious, terrible change had come over the elephant. He neither stirred nor fell, but every line of his body had altered. He looked suddenly stricken, shrunken, immensely old, as though the frightful impact of the bullet had paralysed him without knocking him down. At last, after what seemed a long time – it might have been five seconds, I dare say – he sagged flabbily to his knees. His mouth slobbered. An enormous senility seemed to have settled upon him. One could have imagined him thousands of years old. I fired again into the same spot. At the second shot he did not collapse but climbed with desperate slowness to his feet and stood weakly upright, with legs sagging and head drooping. I fired a third time. That was the shot that did for him. You could see the agony of it jolt his whole body and knock the last remnant of strength from his legs. But in falling he seemed for a moment to rise, for as his hind legs collapsed beneath him he seemed to tower upward like a huge rock toppling, his trunk reaching skyward like a tree. He trumpeted, for the first and only time. And then down he came, his belly towards me, with a crash that seemed to shake the ground even where I lay. ",
      "I got up. The Burmans were already racing past me across the mud. It was obvious that the elephant would never rise again, but he was not dead. He was breathing very rhythmically with long rattling gasps, his great mound of a side painfully rising and falling. His mouth was wide open – I could see far down into caverns of pale pink throat. I waited a long time for him to die, but his breathing did not weaken. Finally I fired my two remaining shots into the spot where I thought his heart must be. The thick blood welled out of him like red velvet, but still he did not die. His body did not even jerk when the shots hit him, the tortured breathing continued without a pause. He was dying, very slowly and in great agony, but in some world remote from me where not even a bullet could damage him further. I felt that I had got to put an end to that dreadful noise. It seemed dreadful to see the great beast Lying there, powerless to move and yet powerless to die, and not even to be able to finish him. I sent back for my small rifle and poured shot after shot into his heart and down his throat. They seemed to make no impression. The tortured gasps continued as steadily as the ticking of a clock. ",
      "In the end I could not stand it any longer and went away. I heard later that it took him half an hour to die. Burmans were bringing dash and baskets even before I left, and I was told they had stripped his body almost to the bones by the afternoon. Afterwards, of course, there were endless discussions about the shooting of the elephant. The owner was furious, but he was only an Indian and could do nothing. Besides, legally I had done the right thing, for a mad elephant has to be killed, like a mad dog, if its owner fails to control it. Among the Europeans opinion was divided. The older men said I was right, the younger men said it was a damn shame to shoot an elephant for killing a coolie, because an elephant was worth more than any damn Coringhee coolie. And afterwards I was very glad that the coolie had been killed; it put me legally in the right and it gave me a sufficient pretext for shooting the elephant. I often wondered whether any of the others grasped that I had done it solely to avoid looking a fool. "

      "Like most of my generation, I was brought up on the saying: 'Satan finds some mischief for idle hands to do.' Being a highly virtuous child, I believed all that I was told, and acquired a conscience which has kept me working hard down to the present moment. But although my conscience has controlled my actions, my opinions have undergone a revolution. I think that there is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous, and that what needs to be preached in modern industrial countries is quite different from what always has been preached. Everyone knows the story of the traveler in Naples who saw twelve beggars lying in the sun (it was before the days of Mussolini), and offered a lira to the laziest of them. Eleven of them jumped up to claim it, so he gave it to the twelfth. this traveler was on the right lines. But in countries which do not enjoy Mediterranean sunshine idleness is more difficult, and a great public propaganda will be required to inaugurate it. I hope that, after reading the following pages, the leaders of the YMCA will start a campaign to induce good young men to do nothing. If so, I shall not have lived in vain. ",
       "Before advancing my own arguments for laziness, I must dispose of one which I cannot accept. Whenever a person who already has enough to live on proposes to engage in some everyday kind of job, such as school-teaching or typing, he or she is told that such conduct takes the bread out of other people's mouths, and is therefore wicked. If this argument were valid, it would only be necessary for us all to be idle in order that we should all have our mouths full of bread. What people who say such things forget is that what a man earns he usually spends, and in spending he gives employment. As long as a man spends his income, he puts just as much bread into people's mouths in spending as he takes out of other people's mouths in earning. The real villain, from this point of view, is the man who saves. If he merely puts his savings in a stocking, like the proverbial French peasant, it is obvious that they do not give employment. If he invests his savings, the matter is less obvious, and different cases arise. ",
       "One of the commonest things to do with savings is to lend them to some Government. In view of the fact that the bulk of the public expenditure of most civilized Governments consists in payment for past wars or preparation for future wars, the man who lends his money to a Government is in the same position as the bad men in Shakespeare who hire murderers. The net result of the man's economical habits is to increase the armed forces of the State to which he lends his savings. Obviously it would be better if he spent the money, even if he spent it in drink or gambling. ",
       "But, I shall be told, the case is quite different when savings are invested in industrial enterprises. When such enterprises succeed, and produce something useful, this may be conceded. In these days, however, no one will deny that most enterprises fail. That means that a large amount of human labor, which might have been devoted to producing something that could be enjoyed, was expended on producing machines which, when produced, lay idle and did no good to anyone. The man who invests his savings in a concern that goes bankrupt is therefore injuring others as well as himself. If he spent his money, say, in giving parties for his friends, they (we may hope) would get pleasure, and so would all those upon whom he spent money, such as the butcher, the baker, and the bootlegger. But if he spends it (let us say) upon laying down rails for surface card in some place where surface cars turn out not to be wanted, he has diverted a mass of labor into channels where it gives pleasure to no one. Nevertheless, when he becomes poor through failure of his investment he will be regarded as a victim of undeserved misfortune, whereas the gay spendthrift, who has spent his money philanthropically, will be despised as a fool and a frivolous person.",
       "All this is only preliminary. I want to say, in all seriousness, that a great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by belief in the virtuousness of work, and that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized diminution of work. ",
        "First of all: what is work? Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earth's surface relatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first kind is unpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid. The second kind is capable of indefinite extension: there are not only those who give orders, but those who give advice as to what orders should be given. Usually two opposite kinds of advice are given simultaneously by two organized bodies of men; this is called politics. The skill required for this kind of work is not knowledge of the subjects as to which advice is given, but knowledge of the art of persuasive speaking and writing, i.e. of advertising. ",
        "Throughout Europe, though not in America, there is a third class of men, more respected than either of the classes of workers. There are men who, through ownership of land, are able to make others pay for the privilege of being allowed to exist and to work. These landowners are idle, and I might therefore be expected to praise them. Unfortunately, their idleness is only rendered possible by the industry of others; indeed their desire for comfortable idleness is historically the source of the whole gospel of work. The last thing they have ever wished is that others should follow their example. ",
        "From the beginning of civilization until the Industrial Revolution, a man could, as a rule, produce by hard work little more than was required for the subsistence of himself and his family, although his wife worked at least as hard as he did, and his children added their labor as soon as they were old enough to do so. The small surplus above bare necessaries was not left to those who produced it, but was appropriated by warriors and priests. In times of famine there was no surplus; the warriors and priests, however, still secured as much as at other times, with the result that many of the workers died of hunger. This system persisted in Russia until 1917 [1], and still persists in the East; in England, in spite of the Industrial Revolution, it remained in full force throughout the Napoleonic wars, and until a hundred years ago, when the new class of manufacturers acquired power. In America, the system came to an end with the Revolution, except in the South, where it persisted until the Civil War. A system which lasted so long and ended so recently has naturally left a profound impress upon men's thoughts and opinions. Much that we take for granted about the desirability of work is derived from this system, and, being preindustrial, is not adapted to the modern world. Modern technique has made it possible for leisure, within limits, to be not the prerogative of small privileged classes, but a right evenly distributed throughout the community. The morality of work is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has no need of slavery. ",
        "It is obvious that, in primitive communities, peasants, left to themselves, would not have parted with the slender surplus upon which the warriors and priests subsisted, but would have either produced less or consumed more. At first, sheer force compelled them to produce and part with the surplus. Gradually, however, it was found possible to induce many of them to accept an ethic according to which it was their duty to work hard, although part of their work went to support others in idleness. By this means the amount of compulsion required was lessened, and the expenses of government were diminished. To this day, 99 per cent of British wage-earners would be genuinely shocked if it were proposed that the King should not have a larger income than a working man. The conception of duty, speaking historically, has been a means used by the holders of power to induce others to live for the interests of their masters rather than for their own. Of course the holders of power conceal this fact from themselves by managing to believe that their interests are identical with the larger interests of humanity. Sometimes this is true; Athenian slave-owners, for instance, employed part of their leisure in making a permanent contribution to civilization which would have been impossible under a just economic system. Leisure is essential to civilization, and in former times leisure for the few was only rendered possible by the labors of the many. But their labors were valuable, not because work is good, but because leisure is good. And with modern technique it would be possible to distribute leisure justly without injury to civilization. ",
        "Modern technique has made it possible to diminish enormously the amount of labor required to secure the necessaries of life for everyone. This was made obvious during the war. At that time all the men in the armed forces, and all the men and women engaged in the production of munitions, all the men and women engaged in spying, war propaganda, or Government offices connected with the war, were withdrawn from productive occupations. In spite of this, the general level of well-being among unskilled wage-earners on the side of the Allies was higher than before or since. The significance of this fact was concealed by finance: borrowing made it appear as if the future was nourishing the present. But that, of course, would have been impossible; a man cannot eat a loaf of bread that does not yet exist. The war showed conclusively that, by the scientific organization of production, it is possible to keep modern populations in fair comfort on a small part of the working capacity of the modern world. If, at the end of the war, the scientific organization, which had been created in order to liberate men for fighting and munition work, had been preserved, and the hours of the week had been cut down to four, all would have been well. Instead of that the old chaos was restored, those whose work was demanded were made to work long hours, and the rest were left to starve as unemployed. Why? Because work is a duty, and a man should not receive wages in proportion to what  he has produced, but in proportion to his virtue as exemplified by his industry. ",
        "This is the morality of the Slave State, applied in circumstances totally unlike those in which it arose. No wonder the result has been disastrous. Let us take an illustration. Suppose that, at a given moment, a certain number of people are engaged in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the world needs, working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the same number of men can make twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world, everybody concerned in the manufacturing of pins would take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked. In this way, it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of happiness. Can anything more insane be imagined? ",
        "The idea that the poor should have leisure has always been shocking to the rich. In England, in the early nineteenth century, fifteen hours was the ordinary day's work for a man; children sometimes did as much, and very commonly did twelve hours a day. When meddlesome busybodies suggested that perhaps these hours were rather long, they were told that work kept adults from drink and children from mischief. When I was a child, shortly after urban working men had acquired the vote, certain public holidays were established by law, to the great indignation of the upper classes. I remember hearing an old Duchess say: 'What do the poor want with holidays? They ought to work.' People nowadays are less frank, but the sentiment persists, and is the source of much of our economic confusion. ",
        "Let us, for a moment, consider the ethics of work frankly, without superstition. Every human being, of necessity, consumes, in the course of his life, a certain amount of the produce of human labor. Assuming, as we may, that labor is on the whole disagreeable, it is unjust that a man should consume more than he produces. Of course he may provide services rather than commodities, like a medical man, for example; but he should provide something in return for his board and lodging. to this extent, the duty of work must be admitted, but to this extent only. ",
        "I shall not dwell upon the fact that, in all modern societies outside the USSR, many people escape even this minimum amount of work, namely all those who inherit money and all those who marry money. I do not think the fact that these people are allowed to be idle is nearly so harmful as the fact that wage-earners are expected to overwork or starve. ",
        "If the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours a day, there would be enough for everybody and no unemployment -- assuming a certain very moderate amount of sensible organization. This idea shocks the well-to-do, because they are convinced that the poor would not know how to use so much leisure. In America men often work long hours even when they are well off; such men, naturally, are indignant at the idea of leisure for wage-earners, except as the grim punishment of unemployment; in fact, they dislike leisure even for their sons. Oddly enough, while they wish their sons to work so hard as to have no time to be civilized, they do not mind their wives and daughters having no work at all. the snobbish admiration of uselessness, which, in an aristocratic society, extends to both sexes, is, under a plutocracy, confined to women; this, however, does not make it any more in agreement with common sense. ",
        "The wise use of leisure, it must be conceded, is a product of civilization and education. A man who has worked long hours all his life will become bored if he becomes suddenly idle. But without a considerable amount of leisure a man is cut off from many of the best things. There is no longer any reason why the bulk of the population should suffer this deprivation; only a foolish asceticism, usually vicarious, makes us continue to insist on work in excessive quantities now that the need no longer exists. ",
        "In the new creed which controls the government of Russia, while there is much that is very different from the traditional teaching of the West, there are some things that are quite unchanged. The attitude of the governing classes, and especially of those who conduct educational propaganda, on the subject of the dignity of labor, is almost exactly that which the governing classes of the world have always preached to what were called the 'honest poor'. Industry, sobriety, willingness to work long hours for distant advantages, even submissiveness to authority, all these reappear; moreover authority still represents the will of the Ruler of the Universe, Who, however, is now called by a new name, Dialectical Materialism. ",
        "The victory of the proletariat in Russia has some points in common with the victory of the feminists in some other countries. For ages, men had conceded the superior saintliness of women, and had consoled women for their inferiority by maintaining that saintliness is more desirable than power. At last the feminists decided that they would have both, since the pioneers among them believed all that the men had told them about the desirability of virtue, but not what they had told them about the worthlessness of political power. A similar thing has happened in Russia as regards manual work. For ages, the rich and their sycophants have written in praise of 'honest toil', have praised the simple life, have professed a religion which teaches that the poor are much more likely to go to heaven than the rich, and in general have tried to make manual workers believe that there is some special nobility about altering the position of matter in space, just as men tried to make women believe that they derived some special nobility from their sexual enslavement. In Russia, all this teaching about the excellence of manual work has been taken seriously, with the result that the manual worker is more honored than anyone else. What are, in essence, revivalist appeals are made, but not for the old purposes: they are made to secure shock workers for special tasks. Manual work is the ideal which is held before the young, and is the basis of all ethical teaching. ",
        "For the present, possibly, this is all to the good. A large country, full of natural resources, awaits development, and has has to be developed with very little use of credit. In these circumstances, hard work is necessary, and is likely to bring a great reward. But what will happen when the point has been reached where everybody could be comfortable without working long hours? ",
        "In the West, we have various ways of dealing with this problem. We have no attempt at economic justice, so that a large proportion of the total produce goes to a small minority of the population, many of whom do no work at all. Owing to the absence of any central control over production, we produce hosts of things that are not wanted. We keep a large percentage of the working population idle, because we can dispense with their labor by making the others overwork. When all these methods prove inadequate, we have a war: we cause a number of people to manufacture high explosives, and a number of others to explode them, as if we were children who had just discovered fireworks. By a combination of all these devices we manage, though with difficulty, to keep alive the notion that a great deal of severe manual work must be the lot of the average man. ",
        "In Russia, owing to more economic justice and central control over production, the problem will have to be differently solved. the rational solution would be, as soon as the necessaries and elementary comforts can be provided for all, to reduce the hours of labor gradually, allowing a popular vote to decide, at each stage, whether more leisure or more goods were to be preferred. But, having taught the supreme virtue of hard work, it is difficult to see how the authorities can aim at a paradise in which there will be much leisure and little work. It seems more likely that they will find continually fresh schemes, by which present leisure is to be sacrificed to future productivity. I read recently of an ingenious plan put forward by Russian engineers, for making the White Sea and the northern coasts of Siberia warm, by putting a dam across the Kara Sea. An admirable project, but liable to postpone proletarian comfort for a generation, while the nobility of toil is being displayed amid the ice-fields and snowstorms of the Arctic Ocean. This sort of thing, if it happens, will be the result of regarding the virtue of hard work as an end in itself, rather than as a means to a state of affairs in which it is no longer needed.",
        "The fact is that moving matter about, while a certain amount of it is necessary to our existence, is emphatically not one of the ends of human life. If it were, we should have to consider every navvy superior to Shakespeare. We have been misled in this matter by two causes. One is the necessity of keeping the poor contented, which has led the rich, for thousands of years, to preach the dignity of labor, while taking care themselves to remain undignified in this respect. The other is the new pleasure in mechanism, which makes us delight in the astonishingly clever changes that we can produce on the earth's surface. Neither of these motives makes any great appeal to the actual worker. If you ask him what he thinks the best part of his life, he is not likely to say: 'I enjoy manual work because it makes me feel that I am fulfilling man's noblest task, and because I like to think how much man can transform his planet. It is true that my body demands periods of rest, which I have to fill in as best I may, but I am never so happy as when the morning comes and I can return to the toil from which my contentment springs.' I have never heard working men say this sort of thing. They consider work, as it should be considered, a necessary means to a livelihood, and it is from their leisure that they derive whatever happiness they may enjoy. ",
        "It will be said that, while a little leisure is pleasant, men would not know how to fill their days if they had only four hours of work out of the twenty-four. In so far as this is true in the modern world, it is a condemnation of our civilization; it would not have been true at any earlier period. There was formerly a capacity for light -heartedness and play which has been to some extent inhibited by the cult of efficiency. The modern man thinks that everything ought to be done for the sake of something else, and never for its own sake. Serious-minded persons, for example, are continually condemning the habit of going to the cinema, and telling us that it leads the young into crime. But all the work that goes to producing a cinema is respectable, because it is work, and because it brings a money profit. The notion that the desirable activities are those that bring a profit has made everything topsy-turvy. The butcher who provides you with meat and the baker who provides you with bread are praiseworthy, because they are making money; but when you enjoy the food they have provided, you are merely frivolous, unless you eat only to get strength for your work. Broadly speaking, it is held that getting money is good and spending money is bad. Seeing that they are two sides of one transaction, this is absurd; one might as well maintain that keys are good, but keyholes are bad. Whatever merit there may be in the production of goods must be entirely derivative from the advantage to be obtained by consuming them. The individual, in our society, works for profit; but the social purpose of his work lies in the consumption of what he produces. It is this divorce between the individual and the social purpose of production that makes it so difficult for men to think clearly in a world in which profit-making is the incentive to industry. We think too much of production, and too little of consumption. One result is that we attach too little importance to enjoyment and simple happiness, and that we do not judge production by the pleasure that it gives to the consumer. ",
        "When I suggest that working hours should be reduced to four, I am not meaning to imply that all the remaining time should necessarily be spent in pure frivolity. I mean that four hours' work a day should entitle a man to the necessities and elementary comforts of life, and that the rest of his time should be his to use as he might see fit. It is an essential part of any such social system that education should be carried further than it usually is at present, and should aim, in part, at providing tastes which would enable a man to use leisure intelligently. I am not thinking mainly of the sort of things that would be considered 'highbrow'. Peasant dances have died out except in remote rural areas, but the impulses which caused them to be cultivated must still exist in human nature. The pleasures of urban populations have become mainly passive: seeing cinemas, watching football matches, listening to the radio, and so on. This results from the fact that their active energies are fully taken up with work; if they had more leisure, they would again enjoy pleasures in which they took an active part.",
        "In the past, there was a small leisure class and a larger working class. The leisure class enjoyed advantages for which there was no basis in social justice; this necessarily made it oppressive, limited its sympathies, and caused it to invent theories by which to justify its privileges. These facts greatly diminished its excellence, but in spite of this drawback it contributed nearly the whole of what we call civilization. It cultivated the arts and discovered the sciences; it wrote the books, invented the philosophies, and refined social relations. Even the liberation of the oppressed has usually been inaugurated from above. Without the leisure class, mankind would never have emerged from barbarism. ",
        "The method of a leisure class without duties was, however, extraordinarily wasteful. None of the members of the class had to be taught to be industrious, and the class as a whole was not exceptionally intelligent. The class might produce one Darwin, but against him had to be set tens of thousands of country gentlemen who never thought of anything more intelligent than fox-hunting and punishing poachers. At present, the universities are supposed to provide, in a more systematic way, what the leisure class provided accidentally and as a by-product. This is a great improvement, but it has certain drawbacks. University life is so different from life in the world at large that men who live in academic milieu tend to be unaware of the preoccupations and problems of ordinary men and women; moreover their ways of expressing themselves are usually such as to rob their opinions of the influence that they ought to have upon the general public. Another disadvantage is that in universities studies are organized, and the man who thinks of some original line of research is likely to be discouraged. Academic institutions, therefore, useful as they are, are not adequate guardians of the interests of civilization in a world where everyone outside their walls is too busy for unutilitarian pursuits. ",
        "In a world where no one is compelled to work more than four hours a day, every person possessed of scientific curiosity will be able to indulge it, and every painter will be able to paint without starving, however excellent his pictures may be. Young writers will not be obliged to draw attention to themselves by sensational pot-boilers, with a view to acquiring the economic independence needed for monumental works, for which, when the time at last comes, they will have lost the taste and capacity. Men who, in their professional work, have become interested in some phase of economics or government, will be able to develop their ideas without the academic detachment that makes the work of university economists often seem lacking in reality. Medical men will have the time to learn about the progress of medicine, teachers will not be exasperatedly struggling to teach by routine methods things which they learnt in their youth, which may, in the interval, have been proved to be untrue. ",
        "Above all, there will be happiness and joy of life, instead of frayed nerves, weariness, and dyspepsia. The work exacted will be enough to make leisure delightful, but not enough to produce exhaustion. Since men will not be tired in their spare time, they will not demand only such amusements as are passive and vapid. At least one per cent will probably devote the time not spent in professional work to pursuits of some public importance, and, since they will not depend upon these pursuits for their livelihood, their originality will be unhampered, and there will be no need to conform to the standards set by elderly pundits. But it is not only in these exceptional cases that the advantages of leisure will appear. Ordinary men and women, having the opportunity of a happy life, will become more kindly and less persecuting and less inclined to view others with suspicion. The taste for war will die out, partly for this reason, and partly because it will involve long and severe work for all. Good nature is, of all moral qualities, the one that the world needs most, and good nature is the result of ease and security, not of a life of arduous struggle. Modern methods of production have given us the possibility of ease and security for all; we have chosen, instead, to have overwork for some and starvation for others. Hitherto we have continued to be as energetic as we were before there were machines; in this we have been foolish, but there is no reason to go on being foolish forever. "

      "In today’s world, where AI tools are basically everywhere—from our phone keyboards to entire websites that can generate stories, songs, and images—it’s kind of impossible to ignore the huge question hanging in the air: when someone uses AI to make something, like a poem or a blog post or a drawing, does that thing actually belong to them?It seems like a simple question at first. You typed the prompt, right? You gave the instructions. Shouldn’t that mean it’s yours? But once you start digging into it, the whole situation gets complicated really fast. This is something that keeps popping up in conversations between students, coders, artists, and even meme makers. It’s not just a legal question—it’s creative, ethical, and even a little emotional.Personally, I’ve used AI tools for a bunch of stuff. Sometimes just for fun—like asking it to generate weird sci-fi scenes—and sometimes for serious projects like coding helpers or writing drafts. But what I’ve noticed is that it’s never as easy as pressing a button. The prompt matters. The way I phrase the question, the way I follow up with more context, the way I tweak the result—that’s where the real work happens. It’s not just “machine go brrr,” it’s me guiding the machine like a tool.",
      "It reminds me a little of how a musician uses instruments or effects to shape their sound. The tool might be complex and powerful, but it doesn’t magically create the final product on its own. The human behind it still has to make decisions. Using AI isn’t that different. The final output reflects the user’s creativity, even if they didn’t write every single word themselves. Legally though, the rules aren’t so clear. In most places, copyright only applies to works made by humans. If something was entirely generated by an AI, with little to no human input, then nobody can officially claim ownership over it. That basically means the content lives in a weird space where you can use it—but so can anyone else. Some AI platforms try to fill in the gaps by giving users rights to whatever they generate, but that’s more about company policy than actual law. So technically, even if you’re allowed to use the stuff you make with AI, it doesn’t mean it’s protected like something you wrote by hand. On top of that, there’s the fact that these AI models are trained on massive datasets full of other people’s work. Think about all the books, songs, websites, tweets, and art that have been fed into these systems. A lot of it came from creators who never agreed to be part of the training data. So even if your AI-generated output looks original, it might be remixing something that already exists. That raises the question—how original is “original” when it comes from a machine that learned by reading everything ever posted online?",
      "Some people use that argument to say that AI content shouldn’t be owned at all, because it’s basically built on borrowed work. I get that, and I think it’s important. But if I’m being honest, it’s not like humans are totally different. Every time we write something or design something, we’re pulling ideas from things we’ve seen, read, heard, or experienced. Human creativity has always been a remix to some degree. AI just makes that process visible and fast. That said, I don’t think every piece of AI content deserves the same treatment. If someone types in a short prompt like “give me a business name” and grabs the first result, I wouldn’t say they “own” that result in a meaningful way. It’s like taking a random sentence off the internet. But if someone puts in real effort—writing a detailed prompt, refining the tone, editing the result, combining it with their own ideas—then that final product starts to feel like theirs. They didn’t just accept whatever came out; they shaped it, pushed it, and made it reflect their own voice or goals. And that shaping matters. It’s the difference between blindly copying something and building something new using raw material. In that way, using AI isn’t so different from using tools like Photoshop or Ableton or a video editor. The software does a lot, but the choices still belong to the person using it. Nobody questions if a digital artist owns the piece they made just because they used filters and brushes they didn’t invent. It should be the same with AI.",
      "Still, I think we’re going to need better systems. Right now, we’re all kind of making it up as we go—students, artists, businesses, even legal experts. Maybe we need some kind of creative license system that recognizes the user’s role without ignoring the model’s origins. Or maybe we’ll just have to rethink how ownership works altogether in this new era of collaboration between humans and machines. Personally, when I use AI tools thoughtfully—when I plan my prompts, guide the model, make choices, and revise the outcome—I do feel like the final product is mine. Not in a greedy, “no one else can touch this” kind of way, but in the sense that it came from me. My ideas. My goals. My edits. The AI helped, but I drove the process. That still counts as creation in my book. This whole thing is still new, and we’re all figuring it out as we go. But one thing seems clear: the people using AI in creative, intentional ways shouldn’t be treated like they’re just pushing buttons. They’re thinking, guiding, imagining. And even if the tools change, that part of the process—that spark of creativity—should always be respected. If we don’t figure out how to honor that, we risk turning creativity into something that’s no longer about expression, but just about automation. And honestly, that’s not a future I want to be part of."

    " Notes From Underground      The author of the diary and the diary itself are, of course, imaginary. Nevertheless it is clear   that such persons as the writer of these notes not only may, but positively must, exist in our   society, when we consider the circumstances in the midst of which our society is formed. I   have tried to expose to the view of the public more distinctly than is commonly done, one of   the characters of the recent past. He is one of the representatives of a generation still living.   In this fragment, entitled \"Underground,\" this person introduces himself and his views, and,   as it were, tries to explain the causes owing to which he has made his appearance and was   bound to make his appearance in our midst. In the second fragment there are added the   actual notes of this person concerning certain events in his life.—Author's Note.   PART I  I   I am a sick man.... I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I believe my liver is   diseased. However, I know nothing at all about my disease, and do not know for certain what   ails me. I don’t consult a doctor for it, and never have, though I have a respect for medicine   and doctors. Besides, I am extremely superstitious, sufficiently so to respect medicine,   anyway (I am well-educated enough not to be superstitious, but I am superstitious). No, I  refuse to consult a doctor from spite. That you probably will not understand. Well, I   understand it, though. Of course, I can’t explain who it is precisely that I am mortifying in  this case by my spite: I am perfectly well aware that I cannot “pay out” the doctors by not   consulting them; I know better than any one that by all this I am only injuring myself and no   one else. But still, if I don’t consult a doctor it is from spite. My liver is bad, well—let it get  worse!  I have been going on like that for a long time—twenty years. Now I am forty. I used to be in   the government service, but am no longer. I was a spiteful official. I was rude and took   pleasure in being so. I did not take bribes, you see, so I was bound to find a recompense in   that, at least. (A poor jest, but I will not scratch it out. I wrote it thinking it would sound very   witty; but now that I have seen myself that I only wanted to show off in a despicable way, I   will not scratch it out on purpose!)   When petitioners used to come for information to the table at which I sat, I used to grind my   teeth at them, and felt intense enjoyment when I succeeded in making anybody unhappy. I   almost always did succeed. For the most part they were all timid people—of course, they   were petitioners. But of the uppish ones there was one officer in particular I could not endure.   He simply would not be humble, and clanked his sword in a disgusting way. I carried on a   feud with him for eighteen months over that sword. At last I got the better of him. He left off  clanking it. That happened in my youth, though.   But do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite? Why, the whole point,   the real sting of it lay in the fact that continually, even in the moment of the acutest spleen, I   was inwardly conscious with shame that I was not only not a spiteful but not even an   embittered man, that I was simply scaring sparrows at random and amusing myself by it. I   might foam at the mouth, but bring me a doll to play with, give me a cup of tea with sugar in   it, and maybe I should be appeased. I might even be genuinely touched, though probably I   should grind my teeth at myself afterwards and lie awake at night with shame for months   after. That was my way.  32",
    " I was lying when I said just now that I was a spiteful official. I was lying from spite. I was   simply amusing myself with the petitioners and with the officer, and in reality I never could   become spiteful. I was conscious every moment in myself of many, very many elements  absolutely opposite to that. I felt them positively swarming in me, these opposite elements. I   knew that they had been swarming in me all my life and craving some outlet from me, but I   would not let them, would not let them, purposely would not let them come out. They   tormented me till I was ashamed: they drove me to convulsions and—sickened me, at last,   how they sickened me! Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am expressing remorse   for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness for something? I am sure you are   fancying that.... However, I assure you I do not care if you are....   It was not only that I could not become spiteful, I did not know how to become anything:   neither spiteful nor kind, neither a rascal nor an honest man, neither a hero nor an insect.   Now, I am living out my life in my corner, taunting myself with the spiteful and useless   consolation that an intelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is only the fool   who becomes anything. Yes, a man in the nineteenth century must and morally ought to be   pre-eminently a characterless creature; a man of character, an active man is pre-eminently a  limited creature. That is my conviction of forty years. I am forty years old now, and you   know forty years is a whole life-time; you know it is extreme old age. To live longer than   forty years is bad manners, is vulgar, immoral. Who does live beyond forty? Answer that,   sincerely and honestly. I will tell you who do: fools and worthless fellows. I tell all old men   that to their face, all these venerable old men, all these silver-haired and reverend seniors! I  tell the whole world that to its face! I have a right to say so, for I shall go on living to sixty   myself. To seventy! To eighty!... Stay, let me take breath....   You imagine no doubt, gentlemen, that I want to amuse you. You are mistaken in that, too. I   am by no means such a mirthful person as you imagine, or as you may imagine; however,   irritated by all this babble (and I feel that you are irritated) you think fit to ask me who am   I—then my answer is, I am a collegiate  assessor . I was in the service that I might have  something to eat (and solely for that reason), and when last year a distant relation left me six   thousand roubles in his will I immediately retired from the service and settled down in my   corner. I used to live in this corner before, but now I have settled down in it. My room is a   wretched, horrid one in the outskirts of the town. My servant is an old country-woman, ill-  natured from stupidity, and, moreover, there is always a nasty smell about her. I am told that   the Petersburg climate is bad for me, and that with my small means it is very expensive to   live in Petersburg. I know all that better than all these sage and experienced counsellors and   monitors.... But I am remaining in Petersburg; I am not going away from Petersburg! I am not   going away because ... ech! Why, it is absolutely no matter whether I am going away or not   going away.   But what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure?   Answer: Of himself.  Well, so I will talk about myself.  II  I want now to tell you, gentlemen, whether you care to hear it or not, why I could not even   become an insect. I tell you solemnly, that I have many times tried to become an insect. But I   was not equal even to that. I swear, gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness—a real   thorough-going illness. For man’s everyday needs, it would have been quite enough to have   the ordinary human consciousness, that is, half or a quarter of the amount which falls to the   lot of a cultivated man of our unhappy nineteenth century, especially one who has the fatal  33",
    " ill-luck to inhabit Petersburg, the most theoretical and intentional town on the   whole terrestrial globe. (There are intentional and unintentional towns.) It would have been  quite enough, for instance, to have the consciousness by which all so-called direct persons   and men of action live. I bet you think I am writing all this from affectation, to be witty at the  expense of men of action; and what is more, that from ill-bred affectation, I am clanking a  sword like my officer. But, gentlemen, whoever can pride himself on his diseases and even   swagger over them?  Though, after all, every one does do that; people do pride themselves on their diseases, and I   do, may be, more than any one. We will not dispute it; my contention was absurd. But yet I   am firmly persuaded that a great deal of consciousness, every sort of consciousness, in fact, is   a disease. I stick to that. Let us leave that, too, for a minute. Tell me this: why does it happen   that at the very, yes, at the very moments when I am most capable of feeling every refinement   of all that is “good and beautiful,” as they used to say at one time, it would, as though of   design, happen to me not only to feel but to do such ugly things, such that.... Well, in short,   actions that all, perhaps, commit; but which, as though purposely, occurred to me at the very   time when I was most conscious that they ought not to be committed. The more conscious I  was of goodness and of all that was “good and beautiful,” the more deeply I sank into my   mire and the more ready I was to sink in it altogether. But the chief point was that all this   was, as it were, not accidental in me, but as though it were bound to be so. It was as though it   were my most normal condition, and not in the least disease or depravity, so that at last all   desire in me to struggle against this depravity passed. It ended by my almost believing   (perhaps actually believing) that this was perhaps my normal condition. But at first, in the   beginning, what agonies I endured in that struggle! I did not believe it was the same with   other people, and all my life I hid this fact about myself as a secret. I was ashamed (even   now, perhaps, I am ashamed): I got to the point of feeling a sort of secret abnormal,   despicable enjoyment in returning home to my corner on some disgusting Petersburg night,   acutely conscious that that day I had committed a loathsome action again, that what was done   could never be undone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing, gnawing at myself for it, tearing and   consuming myself till at last the bitterness turned into a sort of shameful accursed sweetness,   and at last—into positive real enjoyment! Yes, into enjoyment, into enjoyment! I insist upon  that. I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people   feel such enjoyment? I will explain; the enjoyment was just from the too intense   consciousness of one’s own degradation; it was from feeling oneself that one had reached the   last barrier, that it was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no escape   for you; that you never could become a different man; that even if time and faith were still   left you to change into something different you would most likely not wish to change; or if   you did wish to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality there was   nothing for you to change into.   And the worst of it was, and the root of it all, that it was all in accord with the normal   fundamental laws of over-acute consciousness, and with the inertia that was the direct result  of those laws, and that consequently one was not only unable to change but could do   absolutely nothing. Thus it would follow, as the result of acute consciousness, that one is not   to blame in being a scoundrel; as though that were any consolation to the scoundrel once he   has come to realize that he actually is a scoundrel. But enough.... Ech, I have talked a lot of  nonsense, but what have I explained? How is enjoyment in this to be explained? But I will   explain it. I will get to the bottom of it! That is why I have taken up my pen....   I, for instance, have a great deal of  amour propre . I am as suspicious and prone to take  offence as a humpback or a dwarf. But upon my word I sometimes have had moments when   if I had happened to be slapped in the face I should, perhaps, have been positively glad of it. I  34",
    " say, in earnest, that I should probably have been able to discover even in that a peculiar sort   of enjoyment—the enjoyment, of course, of despair; but in despair there are the most intense   enjoyments, especially when one is very acutely conscious of the hopelessness of one’s  position. And when one is slapped in the face—why then the consciousness of being rubbed   into a pulp would positively overwhelm one. The worst of it is, look at it which way one will,   it still turns out that I was always the most to blame in everything. And what is most   humiliating of all, to blame for no fault of my own but, so to say, through the laws of nature.   In the first place, to blame because I am cleverer than any of the people surrounding me. (I   have always considered myself cleverer than any of the people surrounding me, and  sometimes, would you believe it, have been positively ashamed of it. At any rate, I have all   my life, as it were, turned my eyes away and never could look people straight in the face.) To   blame, finally, because even if I had had magnanimity, I should only have had more suffering   from the sense of its uselessness. I should certainly have never been able to do anything from   being magnanimous—neither to forgive, for my assailant would perhaps have slapped me   from the laws of nature, and one cannot forgive the laws of nature; nor to forget, for even if it  were owing to the laws of nature, it is insulting all the same. Finally, even if I had wanted to   be anything but magnanimous, had desired on the contrary to revenge myself on my assailant,   I could not have revenged myself on any one for anything because I should certainly never   have made up my mind to do anything, even if I had been able to. Why should I not have   made up my mind? About that in particular I want to say a few words.   III  With people who know how to revenge themselves and to stand up for themselves in general,   how is it done? Why, when they are possessed, let us suppose, by the feeling of revenge, then   for the time there is nothing else but that feeling left in their whole being. Such a gentleman   simply dashes straight for his object like an infuriated bull with its horns down, and nothing   but a wall will stop him. (By the way: facing the wall, such gentlemen—that is, the “direct”  persons and men of action—are genuinely nonplussed. For them a wall is not an evasion, as   for us people who think and consequently do nothing; it is not an excuse for turning aside, an   excuse for which we are always very glad, though we scarcely believe in it ourselves, as a  rule. No, they are nonplussed in all sincerity. The wall has for them something tranquillizing,   morally soothing, final—maybe even something mysterious ... but of the wall later.)   Well, such a direct person I regard as the real normal man, as his tender mother nature wished   to see him when she graciously brought him into being on the earth. I envy such a man till I   am green in the face. He is stupid. I am not disputing that, but perhaps the normal man should   be stupid, how do you know? Perhaps it is very beautiful, in fact. And I am the more   persuaded of that suspicion, if one can call it so, by the fact that if you take, for instance, the   antithesis of the normal man, that is, the man of acute consciousness, who has come, of   course, not out of the lap of nature but out of a retort (this is almost mysticism, gentlemen,   but I suspect this, too), this retort-made man is sometimes so nonplussed in the presence of   his antithesis that with all his exaggerated consciousness he genuinely thinks of himself as a  mouse and not a man. It may be an acutely conscious mouse, yet it is a mouse, while the   other is a man, and therefore, et cætera, et cætera. And the worst of it is, he himself, his very   own self, looks on himself as a mouse; no one asks him to do so; and that is an important   point. Now let us look at this mouse in action. Let us suppose, for instance, that it feels   insulted, too (and it almost always does feel insulted), and wants to revenge itself, too. There   may even be a greater accumulation of spite in it than in  l’homme de la nature et de la vérité .  The base and nasty desire to vent that spite on its assailant rankles perhaps even more nastily   in it than in  l’homme de la nature et de la vérité . For through his innate stupidity the latter  looks upon his revenge as justice pure and simple; while in consequence of his acute  35",
    " consciousness the mouse does not believe in the justice of it. To come at last to the deed   itself, to the very act of revenge. Apart from the one fundamental nastiness the luckless   mouse succeeds in creating around it so many other nastinesses in the form of doubts and   questions, adds to the one question so many unsettled questions that there inevitably works   up around it a sort of fatal brew, a stinking mess, made up of its doubts, emotions, and of the   contempt spat upon it by the direct men of action who stand solemnly about it as judges and   arbitrators, laughing at it till their healthy sides ache. Of course the only thing left for it is to   dismiss all that with a wave of its paw, and, with a smile of assumed contempt in which it   does not even itself believe, creep ignominiously into its mouse-hole. There in its nasty,   stinking, underground home our insulted, crushed and ridiculed mouse promptly becomes   absorbed in cold, malignant and, above all, everlasting spite. For forty years together it will   remember its injury down to the smallest, most ignominious details, and every time will add,  of itself, details still more ignominious, spitefully teasing and tormenting itself with its own   imagination. It will itself be ashamed of its imaginings, but yet it will recall it all, it will go   over and over every detail, it will invent unheard of things against itself, pretending that those   things might happen, and will forgive nothing. Maybe it will begin to revenge itself, too, but,   as it were, piecemeal, in trivial ways, from behind the stove, incognito, without believing  either in its own right to vengeance, or in the success of its revenge, knowing that from all its   efforts at revenge it will suffer a hundred times more than he on whom it revenges itself,   while he, I daresay, will not even scratch himself. On its deathbed it will recall it all over  again, with interest accumulated over all the years and....   But it is just in that cold, abominable half despair, half belief, in that conscious burying   oneself alive for grief in the underworld for forty years, in that acutely recognized and yet   partly doubtful hopelessness of one’s position, in that hell of unsatisfied desires turned   inward, in that fever of oscillations, of resolutions determined for ever and repented of again   a minute later—that the savour of that strange enjoyment of which I have spoken lies. It is so  subtle, so difficult of analysis, that persons who are a little limited, or even simply persons of   strong nerves, will not understand a single atom of it. “Possibly,” you will add on your own   account with a grin, “people will not understand it either who have never received a slap in   the face,” and in that way you will politely hint to me that I, too, perhaps, have had the  experience of a slap in the face in my life, and so I speak as one who knows. I bet that you are   thinking that. But set your minds at rest, gentlemen, I have not received a slap in the face,  though it is absolutely a matter of indifference to me what you may think about it. Possibly, I   even regret, myself, that I have given so few slaps in the face during my life. But enough ...   not another word on that subject of such extreme interest to you.   I will continue calmly concerning persons with strong nerves who do not understand a certain   refinement of enjoyment. Though in certain circumstances these gentlemen bellow their   loudest like bulls, though this, let us suppose, does them the greatest credit, yet, as I have said  already, confronted with the impossible they subside at once. The impossible means the stone   wall! What stone wall? Why, of course, the laws of nature, the deductions of natural science,   mathematics. As soon as they prove to you, for instance, that you are descended from a   monkey, then it is no use scowling, accept it for a fact. When they prove to you that in reality   one drop of your own fat must be dearer to you than a hundred thousand of your fellow   creatures, and that this conclusion is the final solution of all so-called virtues and duties and  all such prejudices and fancies, then you have just to accept it, there is no help for it, for twice   two is a law of mathematics. Just try refuting it.  “Upon my word, they will shout at you, it is no use protesting: it is a case of twice two makes   four! Nature does not ask your permission, she has nothing to do with your wishes, and  36",
    " whether you like her laws or dislike them, you are bound to accept her as she is, and   consequently all her conclusions. A wall, you see, is a wall ... and so on, and so on.”   Merciful Heavens! but what do I care for the laws of nature and arithmetic, when, for some   reason I dislike those laws and the fact that twice two makes four? Of course I cannot break   through the wall by battering my head against it if I really have not the strength to knock it   down, but I am not going to be reconciled to it simply because it is a stone wall and I have   not the strength.   As though such a stone wall really were a consolation, and really did contain some word of   conciliation, simply because it is as true as twice two makes four. Oh, absurdity of   absurdities! How much better it is to understand it all, to recognize it all, all the   impossibilities and the stone wall; not to be reconciled to one of those impossibilities and   stone walls if it disgusts you to be reconciled to it; by the way of the most inevitable, logical   combinations to reach the most revolting conclusions on the everlasting theme, that even for   the stone wall you are yourself somehow to blame, though again it is as clear as day you are   not to blame in the least, and therefore grinding your teeth in silent impotence to sink into   luxurious inertia, brooding on the fact that there is no one even for you to feel vindictive   against, that you have not, and perhaps never will have, an object for your spite, that it is a   sleight of hand, a bit of juggling, a card-sharper’s trick, that it is simply a mess, no knowing  what and no knowing who, but in spite of all these uncertainties and jugglings, still there is an   ache in you, and the more you do not know, the worse the ache.   IV  “Ha, ha, ha! You will be finding enjoyment in toothache next,” you cry, with a laugh.   “Well? Even in toothache there is enjoyment,” I answer. I had toothache for a whole month  and I know there is. In that case, of course, people are not spiteful in silence, but moan; but   they are not candid moans, they are malignant moans, and the malignancy is the whole point.   The enjoyment of the sufferer finds expression in those moans; if he did not feel enjoyment in   them he would not moan. It is a good example, gentlemen, and I will develop it. Those moans   express in the first place all the aimlessness of your pain, which is so humiliating to   your consciousness; the whole legal system of nature on which you spit disdainfully, of   course, but from which you suffer all the same while she does not. They express the   consciousness that you have no enemy to punish, but that you have pain; the consciousness   that in spite of all possible Vagenheims you are in complete slavery to your teeth; that if   some one wishes it, your teeth will leave off aching, and if he does not, they will go on   aching another three months; and that finally if you are still contumacious and still protest, all   that is left you for your own gratification is to thrash yourself or beat your wall with your fist   as hard as you can, and absolutely nothing more. Well, these mortal insults, these jeers on the   part of some one unknown, end at last in an enjoyment which sometimes reaches the highest   degree of voluptuousness. I ask you, gentlemen, listen sometimes to the moans of an   educated man of the nineteenth century suffering from toothache, on the second or third day   of the attack, when he is beginning to moan, not as he moaned on the first day, that is, not   simply because he has toothache, not just as any coarse peasant, but as a man affected by   progress and European civilization, a man who is “divorced from the soil and the national   elements,” as they express it now-a-days. His moans become nasty, disgustingly malignant,  and go on for whole days and nights. And of course he knows himself that he is doing   himself no sort of good with his moans; he knows better than any one that he is only   lacerating and harassing himself and others for nothing; he knows that even the audience   before whom he is making his efforts, and his whole family, listen to him with loathing, do   not put a ha’porth of faith in him, and inwardly understand that he might moan differently,  37",
    " more simply, without trills and flourishes, and that he is only amusing himself like that from   ill-humour, from malignancy. Well, in all these recognitions and disgraces it is that there lies   a voluptuous pleasure. As though he would say: “I am worrying you, I am lacerating your  hearts, I am keeping every one in the house awake. Well, stay awake then, you, too, feel   every minute that I have toothache. I am not a hero to you now, as I tried to seem before, but   simply a nasty person, an impostor. Well, so be it, then! I am very glad that you see through   me. It is nasty for you to hear my despicable moans: well, let it be nasty; here I will let you   have a nastier flourish in a minute....” You do not understand even now, gentlemen? No, it   seems our development and our consciousness must go further to understand all the   intricacies of this pleasure. You laugh? Delighted. My jests, gentlemen, are of course in bad   taste, jerky, involved, lacking self-confidence. But of course that is because I do not respect   myself. Can a man of perception respect himself at all?  V   Come, can a man who attempts to find enjoyment in the very feeling of his own degradation   possibly have a spark of respect for himself? I am not saying this now from any mawkish   kind of remorse. And, indeed, I could never endure saying, “Forgive me, Papa, I won’t do it  again,” not because I am incapable of saying that—on the contrary, perhaps just because I  have been too capable of it, and in what a way, too! As though of design I used to get into   trouble in cases when I was not to blame in any way. That was the nastiest part of it. At the   same time I was genuinely touched and penitent, I used to shed tears and, of course, deceived   myself, though I was not acting in the least and there was a sick feeling in my heart at the   time.... For that one could not blame even the laws of nature, though the laws of nature have   continually all my life offended me more than anything. It is loathsome to remember it all,   but it was loathsome even then. Of course, a minute or so later I would realize wrathfully that   it was all a lie, a revolting lie, an affected lie, that is, all this penitence, this emotion, these   vows of reform. You will ask why did I worry myself with such antics: answer, because it   was very dull to sit with one’s hands folded, and so one began cutting capers. That is really it.   Observe yourselves more carefully, gentlemen, then you will understand that it is so. I   invented adventures for myself and made up a life, so as at least to live in some way. How   many times it has happened to me—well, for instance, to take offence simply on purpose, for  nothing; and one knows oneself, of course, that one is offended at nothing, that one is putting   it on, but yet one brings oneself, at last to the point of being really offended. All my life I   have had an impulse to play such pranks, so that in the end I could not control it in myself.   Another time, twice, in fact, I tried hard to be in love. I suffered, too, gentlemen, I assure you.   In the depth of my heart there was no faith in my suffering, only a faint stir of mockery, but   yet I did suffer, and in the real, orthodox way; I was jealous, beside myself ... and it was all   from  ennui , gentlemen, all from  ennui ; inertia overcame me. You know the direct, legitimate  fruit of consciousness is inertia, that is, conscious sitting-with-the-hands-folded. I have  referred to this already. I repeat, I repeat with emphasis: all “direct” persons and men of  action are active just because they are stupid and limited. How explain that? I will tell you: in   consequence of their limitation they take immediate and secondary causes for primary ones,   and in that way persuade themselves more quickly and easily than other people do that they   have found an infallible foundation for their activity, and their minds are at ease and you   know that is the chief thing. To begin to act, you know, you must first have your mind   completely at ease and no trace of doubt left in it. Why, how am I, for example to set my  mind at rest? Where are the primary causes on which I am to build? Where are my   foundations? Where am I to get them from? I exercise myself in reflection, and consequently   with me every primary cause at once draws after itself another still more primary, and so on   to infinity. That is just the essence of every sort of consciousness and reflection. It must be a  38",
    " case of the laws of nature again. What is the result of it in the end? Why, just the same.   Remember I spoke just now of vengeance. (I am sure you did not take it in.) I said that a man   revenges himself because he sees justice in it. Therefore he has found a primary cause, that is,   justice. And so he is at rest on all sides, and consequently he carries out his revenge calmly   and successfully, being persuaded that he is doing a just and honest thing. But I see no justice   in it, I find no sort of virtue in it either, and consequently if I attempt to revenge myself, it is   only out of spite. Spite, of course, might overcome everything, all my doubts, and so might   serve quite successfully in place of a primary cause, precisely because it is not a cause. But   what is to be done if I have not even spite (I began with that just now, you know)? In  consequence again of those accursed laws of consciousness, anger in me is subject to   chemical disintegration. You look into it, the object flies off into air, your reasons evaporate,  the criminal is not to be found, the wrong becomes not a wrong but a phantom, something   like the toothache, for which no one is to blame, and consequently there is only the same   outlet left again—that is, to beat the wall as hard as you can. So you give it up with a wave of  the hand because you have not found a fundamental cause. And try letting yourself be carried   away by your feelings, blindly, without reflection, without a primary cause, repelling   consciousness at least for a time; hate or love, if only not to sit with your hands folded. The   day after to-morrow, at the latest, you will begin despising yourself for having knowingly  deceived yourself. Result: a soap-bubble and inertia. Oh, gentlemen, do you know, perhaps I  consider myself an intelligent man, only because all my life I have been able neither to begin  nor to finish anything. Granted I am a babbler, a harmless vexatious babbler, like all of us.   But what is to be done if the direct and sole vocation of every intelligent man is babble, that   is, the intentional pouring of water through a sieve?   VI  Oh, if I had done nothing simply from laziness! Heavens, how I should have respected   myself, then. I should have respected myself because I should at least have been capable of   being lazy; there would at least have been one quality, as it were, positive in me, in which I   could have believed myself. Question: What is he? Answer: A sluggard; how very pleasant it   would have been to hear that of oneself! It would mean that I was positively defined, it would   mean that there was something to say about me. “Sluggard”—why, it is a calling and   vocation, it is a career. Do not jest, it is so. I should then be a member of the best club by   right, and should find my occupation in continually respecting myself. I knew   a gentleman who prided himself all his life on being a connoisseur of Lafitte. He considered  this as his positive virtue, and never doubted himself. He died, not simply with a tranquil, but   with a triumphant, conscience, and he was quite right, too. Then I should have chosen a   career for myself, I should have been a sluggard and a glutton, not a simple one, but, for   instance, one with sympathies for everything good and beautiful. How do you like that? I   have long had visions of it. That “good and beautiful” weighs heavily on my mind at forty.   But that is at forty; then—oh, then it would have been different! I should have found for  myself a form of activity in keeping with it, to be precise, drinking to the health of everything   “good and beautiful.” I should have snatched at every opportunity to drop a tear into my glass   and then to drain it to all that is “good and beautiful.” I should then have turned everything   into the good and the beautiful; in the nastiest, unquestionable trash, I should have sought out   the good and the beautiful. I should have exuded tears like a wet sponge. An artist, for   instance, paints a picture worthy of Gay. At once I drink to the health of the artist who   painted the picture worthy of Gay, because I love all that is “good and beautiful.” An author   has written  As you will : at once I drink to the health of “any one you will” because I love all  that is “good and beautiful.”  39",
    " I should claim respect for doing so. I should persecute any one who would not show me   respect. I should live at ease, I should die with dignity, why, it is charming, perfectly   charming! And what a good round belly I should have grown, what a treble chin I should   have established, what a ruby nose I should have coloured for myself, so that every one   would have said, looking at me: “Here is an asset! Here is something real and solid!” And,  say what you like, it is very agreeable to hear such remarks about oneself in this negative age.   VII   But these are all golden dreams. Oh, tell me, who was it first announced, who was it first   proclaimed, that man only does nasty things because he does not know his own interests; and   that if he were enlightened, if his eyes were opened to his real normal interests, man would at   once cease to do nasty things, would at once become good and noble because, being   enlightened and understanding his real advantage, he would see his own advantage in the   good and nothing else, and we all know that not one man can, consciously, act against his   own interests, consequently, so to say, through necessity, he would begin doing good? Oh,   the babe! Oh, the pure, innocent child! Why, in the first place, when in all these thousands of   years has there been a time when man has acted only from his own interest? What is to be   done with the millions of facts that bear witness that men,  consciously , that is fully  understanding their real interests, have left them in the background and have rushed headlong   on another path, to meet peril and danger, compelled to this course by nobody and by   nothing, but, as it were, simply disliking the beaten track, and have obstinately, wilfully,   struck out another difficult, absurd way, seeking it almost in the darkness. So, I suppose, this   obstinacy and perversity were pleasanter to them than any advantage.... Advantage! What is   advantage? And will you take it upon yourself to define with perfect accuracy in what the   advantage of man consists? And what if it so happens that a man’s advantage,  sometimes , not  only may, but even must, consist in his desiring in certain cases what is harmful to himself   and not advantageous? And if so, if there can be such a case, the whole principle falls into   dust. What do you think—are there such cases? You laugh; laugh away, gentlemen, but only   answer me: have man’s advantages been reckoned up with perfect certainty? Are there not  some which not only have not been included but cannot possibly be included under any   classification? You see, you gentlemen have, to the best of my knowledge, taken your whole   register of human advantages from the averages of statistical figures and politico-economical  formulas. Your advantages are prosperity, wealth, freedom, peace—and so on, and so on. So   that the man who should, for instance, go openly and knowingly in opposition to all that list   would, to your thinking, and indeed mine, too, of course, be an obscurantist or an absolute   madman: would not he? But, you know, this is what is surprising: why does it so happen that   all these statisticians, sages and lovers of humanity, when they reckon up human advantages   invariably leave out one? They don’t even take it into their reckoning in the form in which it   should be taken, and the whole reckoning depends upon that. It would be no great matter,   they would simply have to take it, this advantage, and add it to the list. But the trouble is, that   this strange advantage does not fall under any classification and is not in place in any list. I  have a friend for instance.... Ech! gentlemen, but of course he is your friend, too; and indeed   there is no one, no one, to whom he is not a friend! When he prepares for any undertaking   this gentleman immediately explains to you, elegantly and clearly, exactly how he must act in   accordance with the laws of reason and truth. What is more, he will talk to you with   excitement and passion of the true normal interests of man; with irony he will upbraid the   shortsighted fools who do not understand their own interests, nor the true significance of   virtue; and, within a quarter of an hour, without any sudden outside provocation, but simply   through something inside him which is stronger than all his interests, he will go off on quite a   different tack—that is, act in direct opposition to what he has just been saying about himself,  40",
    " in opposition to the laws of reason, in opposition to his own advantage, in fact in opposition   to everything.... I warn you that my friend is a compound personality, and therefore it is   difficult to blame him as an individual. The fact is, gentlemen, it seems there must really exist   something that is dearer to almost every man than his greatest advantages, or (not to be   illogical) there is a most advantageous advantage (the very one omitted of which we spoke   just now) which is more important and more advantageous than all other advantages, for the   sake of which a man if necessary is ready to act in opposition to all laws; that is, in opposition   to reason, honour, peace, prosperity—in fact, in opposition to all those excellent and useful   things if only he can attain that fundamental, most advantageous advantage which is dearer to   him than all. “Yes, but it’s advantage all the same” you will retort. But excuse me, I’ll make  the point clear, and it is not a case of playing upon words. What matters is, that this   advantage is remarkable from the very fact that it breaks down all our classifications, and   continually shatters every system constructed by lovers of mankind for the benefit of   mankind. In fact, it upsets everything. But before I mention this advantage to you, I want to   compromise myself personally, and therefore I boldly declare that all these fine systems, all   these theories for explaining to mankind their real normal interests, in order that inevitably  striving to pursue these interests they may at once become good and noble—are, in my   opinion, so far, mere logical exercises! Yes, logical exercises. Why, to maintain this theory of   the regeneration of mankind by means of the pursuit of his own advantage is to my mind   almost the same thing as ... as to affirm, for instance, following Buckle, that through   civilization mankind becomes softer, and consequently less bloodthirsty and less fitted for   warfare. Logically it does seem to follow from his arguments. But man has such a  predilection for systems and abstract deductions that he is ready to distort the truth   intentionally, he is ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to justify his logic. I take   this example because it is the most glaring instance of it. Only look about you: blood is being  spilt in streams, and in the merriest way, as though it were champagne. Take the whole of the   nineteenth century in which Buckle lived. Take Napoleon—the Great and also the present   one. Take North America—the eternal union. Take the farce of Schleswig-Holstein.... And  what is it that civilization softens in us? The only gain of civilization for mankind is the   greater capacity for variety of sensations—and absolutely nothing more. And through the  development of this many-sidedness man may come to finding enjoyment in bloodshed. In   fact, this has already happened to him. Have you noticed that it is the most civilized   gentlemen who have been the subtlest slaughterers, to whom the Attilas and Stenka Razins   could not hold a candle, and if they are not so conspicuous as the Attilas and Stenka Razins it   is simply because they are so often met with, are so ordinary and have become so familiar to   us. In any case civilization has made mankind if not more bloodthirsty, at least more vilely,   more loathsomely bloodthirsty. In old days he saw justice in bloodshed and with his   conscience at peace exterminated those he thought proper. Now we do think bloodshed   abominable and yet we engage in this abomination, and with more energy than ever. Which is   worse? Decide that for yourselves. They say that Cleopatra (excuse an instance from Roman   history) was fond of sticking gold pins into her slave-girls’ breasts and derived gratification  from their screams and writhings. You will say that that was in the comparatively barbarous   times; that these are barbarous times too, because also, comparatively speaking, pins are   stuck in even now; that though man has now learned to see more clearly than in barbarous   ages, he is still far from having learnt to act as reason and science would dictate. But yet you   are fully convinced that he will be sure to learn when he gets rid of certain old bad habits, and   when common sense and science have completely re-educated human nature and turned it in   a normal direction. You are confident that then man will cease from  intentional  error and  will, so to say, be compelled not to want to set his will against his normal interests. That is   not all; then, you say, science itself will teach man (though to my mind it’s a superfluous  41",
    " luxury) that he never has really had any caprice or will of his own, and that he himself is   something of the nature of a piano-key or the stop of an organ, and that there are, besides,   things called the laws of nature; so that everything he does is not done by his willing it, but is   done of itself, by the laws of nature. Consequently we have only to discover these laws of   nature, and man will no longer have to answer for his actions and life will become   exceedingly easy for him. All human actions will then, of course, be tabulated according to   these laws, mathematically, like tables of logarithms up to 108,000, and entered in an index;   or, better still, there would be published certain edifying works of the nature of encyclopædic   lexicons, in which everything will be so clearly calculated and explained that there will be no   more incidents or adventures in the world.   Then—this is all what you say—new economic relations will be established, all ready-made  and worked out with mathematical exactitude, so that every possible question will vanish in   the twinkling of an eye, simply because every possible answer to it will be provided. Then the   “Palace of Crystal” will be built. Then.... In fact, those will be halcyon days. Of course there  is no guaranteeing (this is my comment) that it will not be, for instance, frightfully dull then   (for what will one have to do when everything will be calculated and tabulated?), but on the   other hand everything will be extraordinarily rational. Of course boredom may lead you to   anything. It is boredom sets one sticking golden pins into people, but all that would not   matter. What is bad (this is my comment again) is that I dare say people will be thankful for   the gold pins then. Man is stupid, you know, phenomenally stupid; or rather he is not at all   stupid, but he is so ungrateful that you could not find another like him in all creation. I, for   instance, would not be in the least surprised if all of a sudden,  à propos  of nothing, in the  midst of general prosperity a gentleman with an ignoble, or rather with a reactionary and   ironical, countenance were to arise and, putting his arms akimbo, say to us all: “I say,   gentlemen, hadn’t we better kick over the whole show and scatter rationalism to the winds,   simply to send these logarithms to the devil, and to enable us to live once more at our own   sweet foolish will!” That again would not matter; but what is annoying is that he would be  sure to find followers—such is the nature of man. And all that for the most foolish reason,   which, one would think, was hardly worth mentioning: that is, that man everywhere and at all   times, whoever he may be, has preferred to act as he chose and not in the least as his reason   and advantage dictated. And one may choose what is contrary to one’s own interests, and   sometimes one  positively ought  (that is my idea). One’s own free unfettered choice, one’s  own caprice, however wild it may be, one’s own fancy worked up at times to frenzy—is that   very “most advantageous advantage” which we have overlooked, which comes under no   classification and against which all systems and theories are continually being shattered to   atoms. And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice? What   has made them conceive that man must want a rationally advantageous choice? What man  wants is simply  independent  choice, whatever that independence may cost and wherever it  may lead. And choice, of course, the devil only knows what choice....   VIII   “Ha! ha! ha! But you know there is no such thing as choice in reality, say what you like,” you   will interpose with a chuckle. “Science has succeeded in so far analysing man that we know   already that choice and what is called freedom of will is nothing else than——”   Stay, gentlemen, I meant to begin with that myself. I confess, I was rather frightened. I was   just going to say that the devil only knows what choice depends on, and that perhaps that was   a very good thing, but I remembered the teaching of science ... and pulled myself up. And   here you have begun upon it. Indeed, if there really is some day discovered a formula for all   our desires and caprices—that is, an explanation of what they depend upon, by what laws  42",
    " they arise, how they develop, what they are aiming at in one case and in another and so on,   that is a real mathematical formula—then, most likely, man will at once cease to feel desire,  indeed, he will be certain to. For who would want to choose by rule? Besides, he will at once  be transformed from a human being into an organ-stop or something of the sort; for what is a   man without desires, without free will and without choice, if not a stop in an organ? What do  you think? Let us reckon the chances—can such a thing happen or not?   “H’m!” you decide. “Our choice is usually mistaken from a false view of our advantage. We  sometimes choose absolute nonsense because in our foolishness we see in that nonsense the   easiest means for attaining a supposed advantage. But when all that is explained and worked   out on paper (which is perfectly possible, for it is contemptible and senseless to suppose that   some laws of nature man will never understand), then certainly so-called desires will no  longer exist. For if a desire should come into conflict with reason we shall then reason and   not desire, because it will be impossible retaining our reason to be  senseless  in our desires,  and in that way knowingly act against reason and desire to injure ourselves. And as all choice   and reasoning can be really calculated—because there will some day be discovered the laws  of our so-called free will—so, joking apart, there may one day be something like a table  constructed of them, so that we really shall choose in accordance with it. If, for instance,   some day they calculate and prove to me that I made a long nose at some one because I could   not help making a long nose at him and that I had to do it in that particular way,   what  freedom  is left me, especially if I am a learned man and have taken my degree  somewhere? Then I should be able to calculate my whole life for thirty years beforehand. In   short, if this could be arranged there would be nothing left for us to do; anyway, we should   have to understand that. And, in fact, we ought unwearyingly to repeat to ourselves that at   such and such a time and in such and such circumstances nature does not ask our leave; that   we have got to take her as she is and not fashion her to suit our fancy, and if we really aspire  to formulas and tables of rules, and well, even ... to the chemical retort, there’s no help for it,   we must accept the retort too, or else it will be accepted without our consent....”   Yes, but here I come to a stop! Gentlemen, you must excuse me for being over-philosophical;   it’s the result of forty years underground! Allow me to indulge my fancy. You see,   gentlemen, reason is an excellent thing, there’s no disputing that, but reason is nothing but   reason and satisfies only the rational side of man’s nature, while will is a manifestation of the  whole life, that is, of the whole human life including reason and all the impulses. And   although our life, in this manifestation of it, is often worthless, yet it is life and not simply   extracting square roots. Here I, for instance, quite naturally want to live, in order to satisfy all   my capacities for life, and not simply my capacity for reasoning, that is, not simply one   twentieth of my capacity for life. What does reason know? Reason only knows what it has   succeeded in learning (some things, perhaps, it will never learn; this is a poor comfort, but   why not say so frankly?) and human nature acts as a whole, with everything that is in it,   consciously or unconsciously, and, even if it goes wrong, it lives. I suspect, gentlemen, that   you are looking at me with compassion; you tell me again that an enlightened and developed   man, such, in short, as the future man will be, cannot consciously desire anything   disadvantageous to himself, that that can be proved mathematically. I thoroughly agree, it   can—by mathematics. But I repeat for the hundredth time, there is one case, one only, when  man may consciously, purposely, desire what is injurious to himself, what is stupid, very   stupid—simply in order to have the right to desire for himself even what is very stupid and   not to be bound by an obligation to desire only what is sensible. Of course, this very stupid   thing, this caprice of ours, may be in reality, gentlemen, more advantageous for us than   anything else on earth, especially in certain cases. And in particular it may be more   advantageous than any advantage even when it does us obvious harm, and contradicts the  43",
    " soundest conclusions of our reason concerning our advantage—for in any circumstances it   preserves for us what is most precious and most important—that is, our personality, our   individuality. Some, you see, maintain that this really is the most precious thing for mankind;   choice can, of course, if it chooses, be in agreement with reason; and especially if this be not   abused but kept within bounds. It is profitable and sometimes even praiseworthy. But very   often, and even most often, choice is utterly and stubbornly opposed to reason ... and ... and ...   do you know that that, too, is profitable, sometimes even praiseworthy? Gentlemen, let us   suppose that man is not stupid. (Indeed one cannot refuse to suppose that, if only from the   one consideration, that, if man is stupid, then who is wise?) But if he is not stupid, he is   monstrously ungrateful! Phenomenally ungrateful. In fact, I believe that the best definition of   man is the ungrateful biped. But that is not all, that is not his worst defect; his worst defect is  his perpetual moral obliquity, perpetual—from the days of the Flood to the Schleswig-  Holstein period. Moral obliquity and consequently lack of good sense; for it has long been   accepted that lack of good sense is due to no other cause than moral obliquity. Put it to the   test and cast your eyes upon the history of mankind. What will you see? Is it a grand   spectacle? Grand, if you like. Take the Colossus of Rhodes, for instance, that’s worth   something. With good reason Mr. Anaevsky testifies of it that some say that it is the work of   man’s hands, while others maintain that it has been created by nature herself. Is it many- coloured? May be it is many-coloured, too: if one takes the dress uniforms, military and   civilian, of all peoples in all ages—that alone is worth something, and if you take the undress  uniforms you will never get to the end of it; no historian would be equal to the job. Is it   monotonous? May be it’s monotonous too: it’s fighting and fighting; they are fighting now,   they fought first and they fought last—you will admit, that it is almost too monotonous. In   short, one may say anything about the history of the world—anything that might enter the   most disordered imagination. The only thing one can’t say is that it’s rational. The very word  sticks in one’s throat. And, indeed, this is the odd thing that is continually happening: there   are continually turning up in life moral and rational persons, sages and lovers of humanity   who make it their object to live all their lives as morally and rationally as possible, to be, so  to speak, a light to their neighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to live   morally and rationally in this world. And yet we all know that those very people sooner or   later have been false to themselves, playing some queer trick, often a most unseemly one.   Now I ask you: what can be expected of man since he is a being endowed with such strange   qualities? Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that   nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such   that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the   continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would   play you some nasty trick. He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the   most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive   good sense his fatal fantastic element. It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar folly that he   will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to himself—as though that were so necessary—  that men still are men and not the keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control   so completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar. And that is not   all: even if man really were nothing but a piano-key, even if this were proved to him by   natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would   purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. And if he   does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all   sorts, only to gain his point! He will launch a curse upon the world, and as only man can   curse (it is his privilege, the primary distinction between him and other animals), may be by  his curse alone he will attain his object—that is, convince himself that he is a man and not a   piano-key! If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated—chaos and darkness  44",
    " and curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand would stop it all, and   reason would reassert itself, then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason   and gain his point! I believe in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to   consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key!   It may be at the cost of his skin, it may be by cannibalism! And this being so, can one help   being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that desire still depends on   something we don’t know?   You will scream at me (that is, if you condescend to do so) that no one is touching my free   will, that all they are concerned with is that my will should of itself, of its own free will,   coincide with my own normal interests, with the laws of nature and arithmetic.  Good Heavens, gentlemen, what sort of free will is left when we come to tabulation and   arithmetic, when it will all be a case of twice two make four? Twice two makes four without   my will. As if free will meant that!  IX  Gentlemen, I am joking, and I know myself that my jokes are not brilliant, but you know one   can’t take everything as a joke. I am, perhaps, jesting against the grain. Gentlemen, I am  tormented by questions; answer them for me. You, for instance, want to cure men of their old   habits and reform their will in accordance with science and good sense. But how do you   know, not only that it is possible, but also that it is  desirable , to reform man in that way? And  what leads you to the conclusion that man’s inclinations  need  reforming? In short, how do  you know that such a reformation will be a benefit to man? And to go to the root of the   matter, why are you so positively convinced that not to act against his real normal interests   guaranteed by the conclusions of reason and arithmetic is certainly always advantageous for  man and must always be a law for mankind? So far, you know, this is only your supposition.   It may be the law of logic, but not the law of humanity. You think, gentlemen, perhaps that I   am mad? Allow me to defend myself. I agree that man is pre-eminently a creative animal,  predestined to strive consciously for an object and to engage in engineering—that is,   incessantly and eternally to make new roads,  wherever they may lead . But the reason why he  wants sometimes to go off at a tangent may just be that he is  predestined  to make the road,  and perhaps, too, that however stupid the “direct” practical man may be, the thought  sometimes will occur to him that the road almost always does lead  somewhere , and that the  destination it leads to is less important than the process of making it, and that the chief thing   is to save the well-conducted child from despising engineering, and so giving way to the fatal  idleness, which, as we all know, is the mother of all the vices. Man likes to make roads and to   create, that is a fact beyond dispute. But why has he such a passionate love for destruction   and chaos also? Tell me that! But on that point I want to say a couple of words myself. May it   not be that he loves chaos and destruction (there can be no disputing that he does sometimes   love it) because he is instinctively afraid of attaining his object and completing the edifice he   is constructing? Who knows, perhaps he only loves that edifice from a distance, and is by no   means in love with it at close quarters; perhaps he only loves building it and does not want to   live in it, but will leave it, when completed, for the use of  les animaux domestiques —such as  the ants, the sheep, and so on. Now the ants have quite a different taste. They have a   marvellous edifice of that pattern which endures for ever—the ant-heap.  With the ant-heap the respectable race of ants began and with the ant-heap they will probably  end, which does the greatest credit to their perseverance and good sense. But man is a   frivolous and incongruous creature, and perhaps, like a chess player, loves the process of the   game, not the end of it. And who knows (there is no saying with certainty), perhaps the only   goal on earth to which mankind is striving lies in this incessant process of attaining, in other  45",
    " words, in life itself, and not in the thing to be attained, which must always be expressed as a   formula, as positive as twice two makes four, and such positiveness is not life, gentlemen, but   is the beginning of death. Anyway, man has always been afraid of this mathematical   certainty, and I am afraid of it now. Granted that man does nothing but seek that   mathematical certainty, he traverses oceans, sacrifices his life in the quest, but to succeed,   really to find it, he dreads, I assure you. He feels that when he has found it there will be   nothing for him to look for. When workmen have finished their work they do at least receive   their pay, they go to the tavern, then they are taken to the police-station—and there is  occupation for a week. But where can man go? Anyway, one can observe a certain   awkwardness about him when he has attained such objects. He loves the process of attaining,   but does not quite like to have attained, and that, of course, is very absurd. In fact, man is a   comical creature; there seems to be a kind of jest in it all. But yet mathematical certainty is,   after all, something insufferable. Twice two makes four seems to me simply a piece of   insolence. Twice two makes four is a pert coxcomb who stands with arms akimbo barring   your path and spitting. I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing, but if we are to  give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too.   And why are you so firmly, so triumphantly, convinced that only the normal and the   positive—in other words, only what is conducive to welfare—is for the advantage of man? Is   not reason in error as regards advantage? Does not man, perhaps, love something besides  well-being? Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering? Perhaps suffering is just as great a benefit  to him as well-being? Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering,   and that is a fact. There is no need to appeal to universal history to prove that; only ask   yourself, if you are a man and have lived at all. As far as my personal opinion is concerned,   to care only for well-being seems to me positively ill-bred. Whether it’s good or bad, it is  sometimes very pleasant, too, to smash things. I hold no brief for suffering nor for well-being   either. I am standing for ... my caprice, and for its being guaranteed to me when necessary.   Suffering would be out of place in vaudevilles, for instance; I know that. In the “Palace of  Crystal” it is unthinkable; suffering means doubt, negation, and what would be the good of a  “palace of crystal” if there could be any doubt about it? And yet I think man will never  renounce real suffering, that is, destruction and chaos. Why, suffering is the sole origin of   consciousness. Though I did lay it down at the beginning that consciousness is the greatest   misfortune for man, yet I know man prizes it and would not give it up for any satisfaction.   Consciousness, for instance, is infinitely superior to twice two makes four. Once you have   mathematical certainty there is nothing left to do or to understand. There will be nothing left   but to bottle up your five senses and plunge into contemplation. While if you stick to   consciousness, even though the same result is attained, you can at least flog yourself at times,   and that will, at any rate, liven you up. Reactionary as it is, corporal punishment is better than   nothing.   X   You believe in a palace of crystal that can never be destroyed—a palace at which one will not  be able to put out one’s tongue or make a long nose on the sly. And perhaps that is just why I   am afraid of this edifice, that it is of crystal and can never be destroyed and that one cannot   put one’s tongue out at it even on the sly.   You see, if it were not a palace, but a hen-house, I might creep into it to avoid getting wet,  and yet I would not call the hen-house a palace out of gratitude to it for keeping me dry. You   laugh and say that in such circumstances a hen-house is as good as a mansion. Yes, I answer,   if one had to live simply to keep out of the rain.  46",
    " But what is to be done if I have taken it into my head that that is not the only object in life,   and that if one must live one had better live in a mansion. That is my choice, my desire. You   will only eradicate it when you have changed my preference. Well, do change it, allure me   with something else, give me another ideal. But meanwhile I will not take a hen-house for a   mansion. The palace of crystal may be an idle dream, it may be that it is inconsistent with the   laws of nature and that I have invented it only through my own stupidity, through the old-  fashioned irrational habits of my generation. But what does it matter to me that it is   inconsistent? That makes no difference since it exists in my desires, or rather exists as long as   my desires exist. Perhaps you are laughing again? Laugh away; I will put up with any  mockery rather than pretend that I am satisfied when I am hungry. I know, anyway, that I will   not be put off with a compromise, with a recurring zero, simply because it is consistent with   the laws of nature and actually exists. I will not accept as the crown of my desires a block of  buildings with tenements for the poor on a lease of a thousand years, and perhaps with a sign-  board of a dentist hanging out. Destroy my desires, eradicate my ideals, show me something   better, and I will follow you. You will say, perhaps, that it is not worth your trouble; but in   that case I can give you the same answer. We are discussing things seriously; but if you won’t  deign to give me your attention, I will drop your acquaintance. I can retreat into my   underground hole.   But while I am alive and have desires I would rather my hand were withered off than bring   one brick to such a building! Don’t remind me that I have just rejected the palace of crystal  for the sole reason that one cannot put out one’s tongue at it. I did not say because I am so   fond of putting my tongue out. Perhaps the thing I resented was, that of all your edifices there   has not been one at which one could not put out one’s tongue. On the contrary, I would let   my tongue be cut off out of gratitude if things could be so arranged that I should lose all   desire to put it out. It is not my fault that things cannot be so arranged, and that one must be   satisfied with model flats. Then why am I made with such desires? Can I have been   constructed simply in order to come to the conclusion that all my construction is a cheat? Can   this be my whole purpose? I do not believe it.   But do you know what: I am convinced that we underground folk ought to be kept on a curb.   Though we may sit forty years underground without speaking, when we do come out into the   light of day and break out we talk and talk and talk....   XI  The long and the short of it is, gentlemen, that it is better to do nothing! Better conscious   inertia! And so hurrah for underground! Though I have said that I envy the normal man to the   last drop of my bile, yet I should not care to be in his place such as he is now (though I shall   not cease envying him). No, no; anyway the underground life is more advantageous. There, at   any rate, one can.... Oh, but even now I am lying! I am lying because I know myself that it is   not underground that is better, but something different, quite different, for which I am   thirsting, but which I cannot find! Damn underground!   I will tell you another thing that would be better, and that is, if I myself believed in anything   of what I have just written. I swear to you, gentlemen, there is not one thing, not one word of   what I have written that I really believe. That is, I believe it, perhaps, but at the same time I   feel and suspect that I am lying like a cobbler.   “Then why have you written all this?” you will say to me.   “I ought to put you underground for forty years without anything to do and then come to you   in your cellar, to find out what stage you have reached! How can a man be left with nothing   to do for forty years?”  47",
    " “Isn’t that shameful, isn’t that humiliating?” you will say, perhaps, wagging your heads  contemptuously. “You thirst for life and try to settle the problems of life by a logical tangle.   And how persistent, how insolent are your sallies, and at the same time what a scare you are   in! You talk nonsense and are pleased with it; you say impudent things and are in continual   alarm and apologizing for them. You declare that you are afraid of nothing and at the same   time try to ingratiate yourself in our good opinion. You declare that you are gnashing your   teeth and at the same time you try to be witty so as to amuse us. You know that your   witticisms are not witty, but you are evidently well satisfied with their literary value. You   may, perhaps, have really suffered, but you have no respect for your own suffering. You may   have sincerity, but you have no modesty; out of the pettiest vanity you expose your sincerity   to publicity and ignominy. You doubtlessly mean to say something, but hide your last word   through fear, because you have not the resolution to utter it, and only have a cowardly   impudence. You boast of consciousness, but you are not sure of your ground, for though your   mind works, yet your heart is darkened and corrupt, and you cannot have a full, genuine   consciousness without a pure heart. And how intrusive you are, how you insist and grimace!   Lies, lies, lies!”  Of course I have myself made up all the things you say. That, too, is from underground. I   have been for forty years listening to you through a crack under the floor. I have invented   them myself, there was nothing else I could invent. It is no wonder that I have learned it by   heart and it has taken a literary form....  But can you really be so credulous as to think that I will print all this and give it to you to   read too? And another problem: why do I call you “gentlemen,” why do I address you as  though you really were my readers? Such confessions as I intend to make are never printed   nor given to other people to read. Anyway, I am not strong-minded enough for that, and I   don’t see why I should be. But you see a fancy has occurred to me and I want to realize it at   all costs. Let me explain.  Every man has reminiscences which he would not tell to every one, but only to his friends.   He has other matters in his mind which he would not reveal even to his friends, but only to   himself, and that in secret. But there are other things which a man is afraid to tell even to  himself, and every decent man has a number of such things stored away in his mind. The   more decent he is, the greater the number of such things in his mind. Anyway, I have only   lately determined to remember some of my early adventures. Till now I have always avoided   them, even with a certain uneasiness. Now, when I am not only recalling them, but have   actually decided to write an account of them, I want to try the experiment whether one can,   even with oneself, be perfectly open and not take fright at the whole truth. I will observe, in   parenthesis, that Heine says that a true autobiography is almost an impossibility, and that man   is bound to lie about himself. He considers that Rousseau certainly told lies about himself in   his confessions, and even intentionally lied, out of vanity. I am convinced that Heine is right;   I quite understand how sometimes one may, out of sheer vanity, attribute regular crimes to   oneself, and indeed I can very well conceive that kind of vanity. But Heine judged of people   who made their confessions to the public. I write only for myself, and I wish to declare once   and for all that if I write as though I were addressing readers, that is simply because it is   easier for me to write in that form. It is a form, an empty form—I shall never have readers. I  have made this plain already....   I don’t wish to be hampered by any restrictions in the compilation of my notes. I shall not   attempt any system or method. I will jot things down as I remember them.  But here, perhaps, some one will catch at the word and ask me: if you really don’t reckon on   readers, why do you make such compacts with yourself—and on paper too—that is, that you  48",
    " won’t attempt any system or method, that you jot things down as you remember them, and so  on, and so on? Why are you explaining? Why do you apologize?   Well, there it is, I answer.  There is a whole psychology in all this, though. Perhaps it is simply that I am a coward. And   perhaps that I purposely imagine an audience before me in order that I may be more dignified   while I write. There are perhaps thousands of reasons. Again, what is my object precisely in   writing? If it is not for the benefit of the public why should I not simply recall these incidents   in my own mind without putting them on paper?   Quite so; but yet it is more imposing on paper. There is something more impressive in it; I   shall be better able to criticize myself and improve my style. Besides, I shall perhaps obtain   actual relief from writing. To-day, for instance, I am particularly oppressed by one memory  of a distant past. It came back vividly to my mind a few days ago, and has remained haunting   me like an annoying tune that one cannot get rid of. And yet I must get rid of it somehow. I   have hundreds of such reminiscences; but at times some one stands out from the hundred and   oppresses me. For some reason I believe that if I write it down I should get rid of it. Why not   try?  Besides, I am bored, and I never have anything to do. Writing will be a sort of work. They   say work makes man kind-hearted and honest. Well, here is a chance for me, anyway.   Snow is falling to-day, yellow and dingy. It fell yesterday, too, and a few days ago. I fancy it  is the wet snow that has reminded me of that incident which I cannot shake off now. And so   let it be a story  à propos  of the falling snow.  PART II   à propos of the wet snow   When from dark error’s subjugation   My words of passionate exhortation   Had wrenched thy fainting spirit free;   And writhing prone in thine affliction   Thou didst recall with malediction  The vice that had encompassed thee:  And when thy slumbering conscience, fretting   By recollection’s torturing flame,  Thou didst reveal the hideous setting   Of thy life’s current ere I came:  When suddenly I saw thee sicken,   And weeping, hide thine anguished face,   Revolted, maddened, horror-stricken,  At memories of foul disgrace.   Nekrassov ( translated by Juliet Soskice ).  I   At that time I was only twenty-four. My life was even then gloomy, ill-regulated, and as  solitary as that of a savage. I made friends with no one and positively avoided talking, and   buried myself more and more in my hole. At work in the office I never looked at any one, and   I was perfectly well aware that my companions looked upon me, not only as a queer fellow,   but even looked upon me—I always fancied this—with a sort of loathing. I sometimes  wondered why it was that nobody except me fancied that he was looked upon with aversion?  49",
    " One of the clerks had a most repulsive, pock-marked face, which looked positively villainous.   I believe I should not have dared to look at any one with such an unsightly countenance.   Another had such a very dirty old uniform that there was an unpleasant odour in his   proximity. Yet not one of these gentlemen showed the slightest self-consciousness—either   about their clothes or their countenance or their character in any way. Neither of them ever   imagined that they were looked at with repulsion; if they had imagined it they would not have   minded—so long as their superiors did not look at them in that way. It is clear to me now   that, owing to my unbounded vanity and to the high standard I set for myself, I often looked   at myself with furious discontent, which verged on loathing, and so I inwardly attributed the   same feeling to every one. I hated my face, for instance: I thought it disgusting, and even   suspected that there was something base in my expression, and so every day when I turned up   at the office I tried to behave as independently as possible, and to assume a lofty expression,  so that I might not be suspected of being abject. “My face may be ugly,” I thought, “but let it  be lofty, expressive, and, above all,  extremely  intelligent.” But I was positively and painfully  certain that it was impossible for my countenance ever to express those qualities. And what   was worst of all, I thought it actually stupid looking, and I would have been quite satisfied if I   could have looked intelligent. In fact, I would even have put up with looking base if, at the   same time, my face could have been thought strikingly intelligent.   Of course, I hated my fellow clerks one and all, and I despised them all, yet at the same time I   was, as it were, afraid of them. In fact, it happened at times that I thought more highly of   them than of myself. It somehow happened quite suddenly that I alternated between despising  them and thinking them superior to myself. A cultivated and decent man cannot be vain   without setting a fearfully high standard for himself, and without despising and almost hating   himself at certain moments. But whether I despised them or thought them superior I dropped  my eyes almost every time I met any one. I even made experiments whether I could face so   and so’s looking at me, and I was always the first to drop my eyes. This worried me to   distraction. I had a sickly dread, too, of being ridiculous, and so had a slavish passion for the   conventional in everything external. I loved to fall into the common rut, and had a whole-  hearted terror of any kind of eccentricity in myself. But how could I live up to it? I was   morbidly sensitive, as a man of our age should be. They were all stupid, and as like one   another as so many sheep. Perhaps I was the only one in the office who fancied that I was a  coward and a slave, and I fancied it just because I was more highly developed. But it was not   only that I fancied it, it really was so. I was a coward and a slave. I say this without the   slightest embarrassment. Every decent man of our age must be a coward and a slave. That is  his normal condition. Of that I am firmly persuaded. He is made and constructed to that very   end. And not only at the present time owing to some casual circumstances, but always, at all   times, a decent man is bound to be a coward and a slave. It is the law of nature for all decent   people all over the earth. If any one of them happens to be valiant about something, he need   not be comforted nor carried away by that; he would show the white feather just the same  before something else. That is how it invariably and inevitably ends. Only donkeys and mules   are valiant, and they only till they are pushed up to the wall. It is not worth while to pay   attention to them for they really are of no consequence.   Another circumstance, too, worried me in those days: that there was no one like me and I was   unlike any one else. “I am alone and they are  every one ,” I thought—and pondered.  From that it is evident that I was still a youngster.  The very opposite sometimes happened. It was loathsome sometimes to go to the office;   things reached such a point that I often came home ill. But all at once,  à propos  of nothing,  there would come a phase of scepticism and indifference (everything happened in phases to  50",
    " me), and I would laugh myself at my intolerance and fastidiousness, I would reproach myself   with being  romantic . At one time I was unwilling to speak to any one, while at other times I  would not only talk, but go to the length of contemplating making friends with them. All my   fastidiousness would suddenly, for no rhyme or reason, vanish. Who knows, perhaps I never   had really had it, and it had simply been affected, and got out of books. I have not decided   that question even now. Once I quite made friends with them, visited their homes, played   preference, drank vodka, talked of promotions.... But here let me make a digression.   We Russians, speaking generally, have never had those foolish transcendental “romantics”— German, and still more French—on whom nothing produces any effect; if there were an  earthquake, if all France perished at the barricades, they would still be the same, they would   not even have the decency to affect a change, but would still go on singing their  transcendental songs to the hour of their death, because they are fools. We, in Russia, have no   fools; that is well known. That is what distinguishes us from foreign lands. Consequently   these transcendental natures are not found amongst us in their pure form. The idea that they   are is due to our “realistic” journalists and critics of that day, always on the look out for  Kostanzhoglos and Uncle Pyotr Ivanitchs and foolishly accepting them as our ideal; they   have slandered our romantics, taking them for the same transcendental sort as in Germany or   France. On the contrary, the characteristics of our “romantics” are absolutely and directly  opposed to the transcendental European type, and no European standard can be applied to   them. (Allow me to make use of this word “romantic”—an old-fashioned and much respected  word which has done good service and is familiar to all). The characteristics of our romantic   are to understand everything,  to see everything and to see it often incomparably more clearly   than our most realistic minds see it ; to refuse to accept anyone or anything, but at the same  time not to despise anything; to give way, to yield, from policy; never to lose sight of a useful   practical object (such as rent-free quarters at the government expense, pensions, decorations),  to keep their eye on that object through all the enthusiasms and volumes of lyrical poems, and   at the same time to preserve “the good and the beautiful” inviolate within them to the hour of   their death, and to preserve themselves also, incidentally, like some precious jewel wrapped   in cotton wool if only for the benefit of “the good and the beautiful.” Our “romantic” is a man  of great breadth and the greatest rogue of all our rogues, I assure you.... I can assure you from   experience, indeed. Of course, that is, if he is intelligent. But what am I saying! The romantic   is always intelligent, and I only meant to observe that although we have had foolish romantics   they don’t count, and they were only so because in the flower of their youth they degenerated   into Germans, and to preserve their precious jewel more comfortably, settled somewhere out   there—by preference in Weimar or the Black Forest.  I, for instance, genuinely despised my official work and did not openly abuse it simply   because I was in it myself and got a salary for it. Anyway, take note, I did not openly abuse it.   Our romantic would rather go out of his mind—a thing, however, which very rarely  happens—than take to open abuse, unless he had some other career in view; and he is never   kicked out. At most, they would take him to the lunatic asylum as “the King of Spain” if he   should go very mad. But it is only the thin, fair people who go out of their minds in Russia.   Innumerable “romantics” attain later in life to considerable rank in the service. Their many- sidedness is remarkable! And what a faculty they have for the most contradictory sensations!   I was comforted by this thought even in those days, and I am of the same opinion now. That   is why there are so many “broad natures” among us who never lose their ideal even in the  depths of degradation; and though they never stir a finger for their ideal, though they are   arrant thieves and knaves, yet they tearfully cherish their first ideal and are extraordinarily   honest at heart. Yes, it is only among us that the most incorrigible rogue can be absolutely   and loftily honest at heart without in the least ceasing to be a rogue. I repeat, our romantics,  51",
    " frequently, become such accomplished rascals (I use the term “rascals” affectionately),  suddenly display such a sense of reality and practical knowledge that their bewildered   superiors and the public generally can only ejaculate in amazement.   Their many-sidedness is really amazing, and goodness knows what it may develop into later  on, and what the future has in store for us. It is not a poor material! I do not say this from any   foolish or boastful patriotism. But I feel sure that you are again imagining that I am joking.   Or perhaps it’s just the contrary, and you are convinced that I really think so. Anyway,  gentlemen, I shall welcome both views as an honour and a special favour. And do forgive my   digression.   I did not, of course, maintain friendly relations with my comrades and soon was at   loggerheads with them, and in my youth and inexperience I even gave up bowing to them, as   though I had cut off all relations. That, however, only happened to me once. As a rule, I was  always alone.  In the first place I spent most of my time at home, reading. I tried to stifle all that was   continually seething within me by means of external impressions. And the only external   means I had was reading. Reading, of course, was a great help—exciting me, giving me   pleasure and pain. But at times it bored me fearfully. One longed for movement in spite of   everything, and I plunged all at once into dark, underground, loathsome vice of the pettiest   kind. My wretched passions were acute, smarting, from my continual, sickly irritability. I had   hysterical impulses, with tears and convulsions. I had no resource except reading, that is,   there was nothing in my surroundings which I could respect and which attracted me. I was   overwhelmed with depression, too; I had an hysterical craving for incongruity and for   contrast, and so I took to vice. I have not said all this to justify myself.... But, no! I am lying.   I did want to justify myself. I make that little observation for my own benefit, gentlemen. I   don’t want to lie. I vowed to myself I would not.   And so, furtively, timidly, in solitude, at night, I indulged in filthy vice, with a feeling of   shame which never deserted me, even at the most loathsome moments, and which at such   moments nearly made me curse. Already even then I had my underground world in my soul. I   was fearfully afraid of being seen, of being met, of being recognized. I visited various   obscure haunts.   One night as I was passing a tavern I saw through a lighted window some gentlemen fighting   with billiard cues, and saw one of them thrown out of window. At other times I should have   felt very much disgusted, but I was in such a mood at the time, that I actually envied the   gentleman thrown out of window—and I envied him so much that I even went into the tavern   and into the billiard-room. “Perhaps,” I thought, “I’ll have a fight, too, and they’ll throw me  out of window.”   I was not drunk—but what is one to do—depression will drive a man to such a pitch of   hysteria? But nothing happened. It seemed that I was not even equal to being thrown out of   window and I went away without having my fight.   An officer put me in my place from the first moment.  I was standing by the billiard-table and in my ignorance blocking up the way, and he wanted   to pass; he took me by the shoulders and without a word—without a warning or   explanation—moved me from where I was standing to another spot and passed by as though   he had not noticed me. I could have forgiven blows, but I could not forgive his having moved   me without noticing me.  52",
    " Devil knows what I would have given for a real regular quarrel—a more decent, a   more  literary  one, so to speak. I had been treated like a fly. This officer was over six foot,  while I was a spindly little fellow. But the quarrel was in my hands. I had only to protest and   I certainly would have been thrown out of the window. But I changed my mind and preferred   to beat a resentful retreat.  I went out of the tavern straight home, confused and troubled, and the next night I went out   again with the same lewd intentions, still more furtively, abjectly and miserably than before,   as it were, with tears in my eyes—but still I did go out again. Don’t imagine, though, it was  cowardice made me slink away from the officer: I never have been a coward at heart, though   I have always been a coward in action. Don’t be in a hurry to laugh—I assure you I can  explain it all.  Oh, if only that officer had been one of the sort who would consent to fight a duel! But no, he   was one of those gentlemen (alas, long extinct!) who preferred fighting with cues or, like   Gogol’s Lieutenant Pirogov, appealing to the police. They did not fight duels and would have   thought a duel with a civilian like me an utterly unseemly procedure in any case—and they   looked upon the duel altogether as something impossible, something free-thinking and   French. But they were quite ready to bully, especially when they were over six foot.   I did not slink away through cowardice, but through an unbounded vanity. I was afraid not of   his six foot, not of getting a sound thrashing and being thrown out of the window; I should   have had physical courage enough, I assure you; but I had not the moral courage. What I was   afraid of was that every one present, from the insolent marker down to the lowest little   stinking, pimply clerk in a greasy collar, would jeer at me and fail to understand when I   began to protest and to address them in literary language. For of the point of honour—not of   honour, but of the point of honour ( point d’honneur )—one cannot speak among us except in  literary language. You can’t allude to the “point of honour” in ordinary language. I was fully  convinced (the sense of reality, in spite of all my romanticism!) that they would all simply   split their sides with laughter, and that the officer would not simply beat me, that is, without   insulting me, but would certainly prod me in the back with his knee, kick me round the   billiard table, and only then perhaps have pity and drop me out of the window.   Of course, this trivial incident could not with me end in that. I often met that officer   afterwards in the street and noticed him very carefully. I am not quite sure whether he   recognized me, I imagine not; I judge from certain signs. But I—I stared at him with spite  and hatred and so it went on ... for several years! My resentment grew even deeper with   years. At first I began making stealthy inquiries about this officer. It was difficult for me to   do so, for I knew no one. But one day I heard some one shout his surname in the street as I   was following him at a distance, as though I were tied to him—and so I learnt his surname.   Another time I followed him to his flat, and for ten kopecks learned from the porter where he   lived, on which storey, whether he lived alone or with others, and so on—in fact, everything   one could learn from a porter. One morning, though I had never tried my hand with the pen, it   suddenly occurred to me to write a satire on this officer in the form of a novel which would   unmask his villainy. I wrote the novel with relish. I did unmask his villainy, I even   exaggerated it; at first I so altered his surname that it could easily be recognized, but on   second thoughts I changed it, and sent the story to the  Otetchestvenniya Zapiski . But at that  time such attacks were not the fashion and my story was not printed. That was a great   vexation to me.   Sometimes I was positively choked with resentment. At last I determined to challenge my   enemy to a duel. I composed a splendid, charming letter to him, imploring him to apologize   to me, and hinting rather plainly at a duel in case of refusal. The letter was so composed that  53",
    " if the officer had had the least understanding of the good and the beautiful he would certainly   have flung himself on my neck and have offered me his friendship. And how fine that would   have been! How we should have got on together! “He could have shielded me with his higher   rank, while I could have improved his mind with my culture, and, well ... my ideas, and all   sorts of things might have happened.” Only fancy, this was two years after his insult to me,   and my challenge would have been a ridiculous anachronism, in spite of all the ingenuity of   my letter in disguising and explaining away the anachronism. But, thank God (to this day I   thank the Almighty with tears in my eyes) I did not send the letter to him. Cold shivers run   down my back when I think of what might have happened if I had sent it.   And all at once I revenged myself in the simplest way, by a stroke of genius! A brilliant   thought suddenly dawned upon me. Sometimes on holidays I used to stroll along the sunny   side of the Nevsky about four o’clock in the afternoon. Though it was hardly a stroll so much   as a series of innumerable miseries, humiliations and resentments; but no doubt that was just   what I wanted. I used to wriggle along in a most unseemly fashion, like an eel, continually   moving aside to make way for generals, for officers of the guards and the hussars, or for   ladies. At such minutes there used to be a convulsive twinge at my heart, and I used to feel   hot all down my back at the mere thought of the wretchedness of my attire, of the   wretchedness and abjectness of my little scurrying figure. This was a regular martyrdom, a   continual, intolerable humiliation at the thought, which passed into an incessant and direct   sensation, that I was a mere fly in the eyes of all this world, a nasty, disgusting fly—more   intelligent, more highly developed, more refined in feeling than any of them, of course—but   a fly that was continually making way for every one, insulted and injured by every one. Why   I inflicted this torture upon myself, why I went to the Nevsky, I don’t know. I felt simply  drawn there at every possible opportunity.   Already then I began to experience a rush of the enjoyment of which I spoke in the first   chapter. After my affair with the officer I felt even more drawn there than before: it was on   the Nevsky that I met him most frequently, there I could admire him. He, too, went there   chiefly on holidays. He, too, turned out of his path for generals and persons of high rank, and   he, too, wriggled between them like an eel; but people, like me, or even better dressed like   me, he simply walked over; he made straight for them as though there was nothing but empty   space before him, and never, under any circumstances, turned aside. I gloated over my   resentment watching him and ... always resentfully made way for him. It exasperated me that   even in the street I could not be on an even footing with him.   “Why must you invariably be the first to move aside?” I kept asking myself in hysterical   rage, waking up sometimes at three o’clock in the morning. “Why is it you and not he?   There’s no regulation about it; there’s no written law. Let the making way be equal as it   usually is when refined people meet: he moves half-way and you move half-way; you pass   with mutual respect.”  But that never happened, and I always moved aside, while he did not even notice my making   way for him. And lo and behold a bright idea dawned upon me! “What,” I thought, “if I meet  him and don’t move on one side? What if I don’t move aside on purpose, even if I knock up   against him? How would that be?” This audacious idea took such a hold on me that it gave   me no peace. I was dreaming of it continually, horribly, and I purposely went more frequently   to the Nevsky in order to picture more vividly how I should do it when I did do it. I was   delighted. This intention seemed to me more and more practical and possible.   “Of course I shall not really push him,” I thought, already more good-natured in my joy. “I  will simply not turn aside, will run up against him, not very violently, but just shouldering   each other—just as much as decency permits. I will push against him just as much as he  54",
    " pushes against me.” At last I made up my mind completely. But my preparations took a great   deal of time. To begin with, when I carried out my plan I should need to be looking rather   more decent, and so I had to think of my get-up. “In case of emergency, if, for instance, there   were any sort of public scandal (and the public there is of the most  recherché : the Countess   walks there; Prince D. walks there; all the literary world is there), I must be well dressed; that   inspires respect and of itself puts us on an equal footing in the eyes of society.”   With this object I asked for some of my salary in advance, and bought at Tchurkin’s a pair of  black gloves and a decent hat. Black gloves seemed to me both more dignified and  bon   ton  than the lemon-coloured ones which I had contemplated at first. “The colour is too gaudy,   it looks as though one were trying to be conspicuous,” and I did not take the lemon-coloured   ones. I had got ready long beforehand a good shirt, with white bone studs; my overcoat was   the only thing that held me back. The coat in itself was a very good one, it kept me warm; but   it was wadded and it had a raccoon collar which was the height of vulgarity. I had to change   the collar at any sacrifice, and to have a beaver one like an officer’s. For this purpose I began  visiting the Gostiny Dvor and after several attempts I pitched upon a piece of cheap German   beaver. Though these German beavers soon grow shabby and look wretched, yet at first they   look exceedingly well, and I only needed it for one occasion. I asked the price; even so, it   was too expensive. After thinking it over thoroughly I decided to sell my raccoon collar. The   rest of the money—a considerable sum for me, I decided to borrow from Anton Antonitch   Syetotchkin, my immediate superior, an unassuming person, though grave and judicious. He   never lent money to any one, but I had, on entering the service, been specially recommended   to him by an important personage who had got me my berth. I was horribly worried. To   borrow from Anton Antonitch seemed to me monstrous and shameful. I did not sleep for two   or three nights. Indeed, I did not sleep well at that time, I was in a fever; I had a vague   sinking at my heart or else a sudden throbbing, throbbing, throbbing! Anton Antonitch was   surprised at first, then he frowned, then he reflected, and did after all lend me the money,  receiving from me a written authorization to take from my salary a fortnight later the sum that   he had lent me.  In this way everything was at last ready. The handsome beaver replaced the mean-looking   raccoon, and I began by degrees to get to work. It would never have done to act off-hand, at   random; the plan had to be carried out skilfully, by degrees. But I must confess that after   many efforts I began to despair: we simply could not run into each other. I made every   preparation, I was quite determined—it seemed as though we should run into one another  directly—and before I knew what I was doing I had stepped aside for him again and he had  passed without noticing me. I even prayed as I approached him that God would grant me   determination. One time I had made up my mind thoroughly, but it ended in my stumbling   and falling at his feet because at the very last instant when I was six inches from him my  courage failed me. He very calmly stepped over me, while I flew on one side like a ball. That   night I was ill again, feverish and delirious.   And suddenly it ended most happily. The night before I had made up my mind not to carry   out my fatal plan and to abandon it all, and with that object I went to the Nevsky for the last   time, just to see how I would abandon it all. Suddenly, three paces from my enemy, I   unexpectedly made up my mind—I closed my eyes, and we ran full tilt, shoulder to shoulder,   against one another! I did not budge an inch and passed him on a perfectly equal footing! He   did not even look round and pretended not to notice it; but he was only pretending, I am   convinced of that. I am convinced of that to this day! Of course, I got the worst of it—he was   stronger, but that was not the point. The point was that I had attained my object, I had kept up   my dignity, I had not yielded a step, and had put myself publicly on an equal social footing   with him. I returned home feeling that I was fully avenged for everything. I was delighted. I  55",
    " was triumphant and sang Italian arias. Of course, I will not describe to you what happened to   me three days later; if you have read my first chapter you can guess that for yourself. The   officer was afterwards transferred; I have not seen him now for fourteen years. What is the  dear fellow doing now? Whom is he walking over?   II  But the period of my dissipation would end and I always felt very sick afterwards. It was   followed by remorse—I tried to drive it away: I felt too sick. By degrees, however, I grew   used to that too. I grew used to everything, or rather I voluntarily resigned myself to enduring   it. But I had a means of escape that reconciled everything—that was to find refuge in “the  good and the beautiful,” in dreams, of course. I was a terrible dreamer, I would dream for   three months on end, tucked away in my corner, and you may believe me that at those   moments I had no resemblance to the gentleman who, in the perturbation of his chicken heart,   put a collar of German beaver on his great coat. I suddenly became a hero. I would not have  admitted my six-foot lieutenant even if he had called on me. I could not even picture him  before me then. What were my dreams and how I could satisfy myself with them—it is hard  to say now, but at the time I was satisfied with them. Though, indeed, even now, I am to   some extent satisfied with them. Dreams were particularly sweet and vivid after a spell of   dissipation; they came with remorse and with tears, with curses and transports. There were   moments of such positive intoxication, of such happiness, that there was not the faintest trace   of irony within me, on my honour. I had faith, hope, love. I believed blindly at such times   that by some miracle, by some external circumstance, all this would suddenly open out,   expand; that suddenly a vista of suitable activity—beneficent, good, and, above all,  ready   made  (what sort of activity I had no idea, but the great thing was that it should be all ready  for me)—would rise up before me—and I should come out into the light of day, almost riding   a white horse and crowned with laurel. Anything but the foremost place I could not conceive   for myself, and for that very reason I quite contentedly occupied the lowest in reality. Either   to be a hero or to grovel in the mud—there was nothing between. That was my ruin, for when   I was in the mud I comforted myself with the thought that at other times I was a hero, and the   hero was a cloak for the mud: for an ordinary man it was shameful to defile himself, but a   hero was too lofty to be utterly defiled, and so he might defile himself. It is worth noting that   these attacks of the “good and the beautiful” visited me even during the period of dissipation   and just at the times when I was touching the bottom. They came in separate spurts, as though   reminding me of themselves, but did not banish the dissipation by their appearance. On the   contrary, they seemed to add a zest to it by contrast, and were only sufficiently present to  serve as an appetizing sauce. That sauce was made up of contradictions and sufferings, of   agonizing inward analysis and all these pangs and pin-pricks gave a certain piquancy, even a   significance to my dissipation—in fact, completely answered the purpose of an appetizing  sauce. There was a certain depth of meaning in it. And I could hardly have resigned myself to   the simple, vulgar, direct debauchery of a clerk and have endured all the filthiness of it. What   could have allured me about it then and have drawn me at night into the street? No, I had a   lofty way of getting out of it all.   And what loving-kindness, oh Lord, what loving-kindness I felt at times in those dreams of  mine! in those “flights into the good and the beautiful;” though it was fantastic love, though it   was never applied to anything human in reality, yet there was so much of this love that one   did not feel afterwards even the impulse to apply it in reality; that would have been   superfluous. Everything, however, passed satisfactorily by a lazy and fascinating transition   into the sphere of art, that is, into the beautiful forms of life, lying ready, largely stolen from   the poets and novelists and adapted to all sorts of needs and uses. I, for instance, was   triumphant over every one; every one, of course, was in dust and ashes, and was forced  56",
    " spontaneously to recognize my superiority, and I forgave them all. I was a poet and a grand   gentleman, I fell in love; I came in for countless millions and immediately devoted them to   humanity, and at the same time I confessed before all the people my shameful deeds, which,   of course, were not merely shameful, but had in them much that was “good and beautiful,”   something in the Manfred style. Every one would kiss me and weep (what idiots they would   be if they did not), while I should go barefoot and hungry preaching new ideas and fighting a   victorious Austerlitz against the obscurantists. Then the band would play a march, an  amnesty would be declared, the Pope would agree to retire from Rome to Brazil; then there   would be a ball for the whole of Italy at the Villa Borghese on the shores of the Lake of   Como, the Lake of Como being for that purpose transferred to the neighbourhood of Rome;   then would come a scene in the bushes, and so on, and so on—as though you did not know all   about it? You will say that it is vulgar and contemptible to drag all this into public after all   the tears and transports which I have myself confessed. But why is it contemptible? Can you   imagine that I am ashamed of it all, and that it was stupider than anything in your life,   gentlemen? And I can assure you that some of these fancies were by no means badly   composed.... It did not all happen on the shores of Lake Como. And yet you are right—it   really is vulgar and contemptible. And most contemptible of all it is that now I am attempting   to justify myself to you. And even more contemptible than that is my making this remark   now. But that’s enough, or there will be no end to it: each step will be more contemptible   than the last....   I could never stand more than three months of dreaming at a time without feeling an   irresistible desire to plunge into society. To plunge into society meant to visit my superior at   the office, Anton Antonitch Syetotchkin. He was the only permanent acquaintance I have had  in my life, and wonder at the fact myself now. But I only went to see him when that phase   came over me, and when my dreams had reached such a point of bliss that it became essential   at once to embrace my fellows and all mankind; and for that purpose I needed, at least, one   human being, actually existing. I had to call on Anton Antonitch, however, on Tuesday—his   at-home day; so I had always to time my passionate desire to embrace humanity so that it  might fall on a Tuesday.   This Anton Antonitch lived on the fourth storey in a house in Five Corners, in four low-  pitched rooms, one smaller than the other, of a particularly frugal and sallow appearance. He   had two daughters and their aunt, who used to pour out the tea. Of the daughters one was   thirteen and another fourteen, they both had snub noses, and I was awfully shy of them   because they were always whispering and giggling together. The master of the house usually   sat in his study on a leather couch in front of the table with some grey-headed gentleman,  usually a colleague from our office or some other department. I never saw more than two or   three visitors there, always the same. They talked about the excise duty; about business in the   senate, about salaries, about promotions, about His Excellency, and the best means of   pleasing him, and so on. I had the patience to sit like a fool beside these people for four hours   at a stretch, listening to them without knowing what to say to them or venturing to say a   word. I became stupified, several times I felt myself perspiring, I was overcome by a sort of   paralysis; but this was pleasant and good for me. On returning home I deferred for a time my   desire to embrace all mankind.  I had however one other acquaintance of a sort, Simonov, who was an old schoolfellow. I had   a number of schoolfellows indeed in Petersburg, but I did not associate with them and had   even given up nodding to them in the street. I believe I had transferred into the department I   was in simply to avoid their company and to cut off all connection with my hateful   childhood. Curses on that school and all those terrible years of penal servitude! In short, I   parted from my schoolfellows as soon as I got out into the world. There were two or three left  57",
    " to whom I nodded in the street. One of them was Simonov, who had been in no way   distinguished at school, was of a quiet and equable disposition; but I discovered in him a   certain independence of character and even honesty. I don’t even suppose that he was   particularly stupid. I had at one time spent some rather soulful moments with him, but these   had not lasted long and had somehow been suddenly clouded over. He was evidently   uncomfortable at these reminiscences, and was, I fancy, always afraid that I might take up the  same tone again. I suspected that he had an aversion for me, but still I went on going to see   him, not being quite certain of it.   And so on one occasion, unable to endure my solitude and knowing that as it was Thursday   Anton Antonitch’s door would be closed, I thought of Simonov. Climbing up to his fourth   storey I was thinking that the man disliked me and that it was a mistake to go and see him.   But as it always happened that such reflections impelled me, as though purposely, to put   myself into a false position, I went in. It was almost a year since I had last seen Simonov.   III  I found two of my old schoolfellows with him. They seemed to be discussing an important   matter. All of them took scarcely any notice of my entrance, which was strange, for I had not   met them for years. Evidently they looked upon me as something on the level of a common   fly. I had not been treated like that even at school, though they all hated me. I knew, of   course, that they must despise me now for my lack of success in the service, and for my   having let myself sink so low, going about badly dressed and so on—which seemed to them a   sign of my incapacity and insignificance. But I had not expected such contempt. Simonov   was positively surprised at my turning up. Even in old days he had always seemed surprised   at my coming. All this disconcerted me: I sat down, feeling rather miserable, and began   listening to what they were saying.   They were engaged in warm and earnest conversation about a farewell dinner which they   wanted to arrange for the next day to a comrade of theirs called Zverkov, an officer in the   army, who was going away to a distant province. This Zverkov had been all the time at   school with me too. I had begun to hate him particularly in the upper forms. In the lower   forms he had simply been a pretty, playful boy whom everybody liked. I had hated him,   however, even in the lower forms, just because he was a pretty and playful boy. He was   always bad at his lessons and got worse and worse as he went on; however, he left with a   good certificate, as he had powerful interest. During his last year at school he came in for an   estate of two hundred serfs, and as almost all of us were poor he took up a swaggering tone   among us. He was vulgar in the extreme, but at the same time he was a good-natured fellow,   even in his swaggering. In spite of superficial, fantastic and sham notions of honour and   dignity, all but very few of us positively grovelled before Zverkov, and the more so the more   he swaggered. And it was not from any interested motive that they grovelled, but simply   because he had been favoured by the gifts of nature. Moreover, it was, as it were, an accepted   idea among us that Zverkov was a specialist in regard to tact and the social graces. This last   fact particularly infuriated me. I hated the abrupt self-confident tone of his voice, his   admiration of his own witticisms, which were often frightfully stupid, though he was bold in   his language; I hated his handsome, but stupid face (for which I would, however, have gladly   exchanged my intelligent one), and the free-and-easy military manners in fashion in the  “‘forties.” I hated the way in which he used to talk of his future conquests of women (he did  not venture to begin his attack upon women until he had the epaulettes of an officer, and was   looking forward to them with impatience), and boasted of the duels he would constantly be   fighting. I remember how I, invariably so taciturn, suddenly fastened upon Zverkov, when   one day talking at a leisure moment with his schoolfellows of his future relations with the fair  58",
    " sex, and growing as sportive as a puppy in the sun, he all at once declared that he would not   leave a single village girl on his estate unnoticed, that that was his  droit de seigneur , and that  if the peasants dared to protest he would have them all flogged and double the tax on them,   the bearded rascals. Our servile rabble applauded, but I attacked him, not from compassion   for the girls and their fathers, but simply because they were applauding such an insect. I got   the better of him on that occasion, but though Zverkov was stupid he was lively and   impudent, and so laughed it off, and in such a way that my victory was not really complete:   the laugh was on his side. He got the better of me on several occasions afterwards, but   without malice, jestingly, casually. I remained angrily and contemptuously silent and would   not answer him. When we left school he made advances to me; I did not rebuff them, for I   was flattered, but we soon parted and quite naturally. Afterwards I heard of his barrack-room   success as a lieutenant, and of the fast life he was leading. Then there came other rumours— of his successes in the service. By then he had taken to cutting me in the street, and I   suspected that he was afraid of compromising himself by greeting a personage as   insignificant as me. I saw him once in the theatre, in the third tier of boxes. By then he was   wearing shoulder-straps. He was twisting and twirling about, ingratiating himself with the  daughters of an ancient General. In three years he had gone off considerably, though he was   still rather handsome and adroit. One could see that by the time he was thirty he would be   corpulent. So it was to this Zverkov that my schoolfellows were going to give a dinner on his   departure. They had kept up with him for those three years, though privately they did not   consider themselves on an equal footing with him, I am convinced of that.   Of Simonov’s two visitors, one was Ferfitchkin, a Russianized German—a little fellow with  the face of a monkey, a blockhead who was always deriding every one, a very bitter enemy of   mine from our days in the lower forms—a vulgar, impudent, swaggering fellow, who affected  a most sensitive feeling of personal honour, though, of course, he was a wretched little   coward at heart. He was one of those worshippers of Zverkov who made up to the latter from   interested motives, and often borrowed money from him. Simonov’s other visitor,  Trudolyubov, was a person in no way remarkable—a tall young fellow, in the army, with a   cold face, fairly honest, though he worshipped success of every sort, and was only capable of   thinking of promotion. He was some sort of distant relation of Zverkov’s, and this, foolish as   it seems, gave him a certain importance among us. He always thought me of no consequence   whatever; his behaviour to me, though not quite courteous, was tolerable.   “Well, with seven roubles each,” said Trudolyubov, “twenty-one roubles between the three of  us, we ought to be able to get a good dinner. Zverkov, of course, won’t pay.”  “Of course not, since we are inviting him,” Simonov decided.   “Can you imagine,” Ferfitchkin interrupted hotly and conceitedly, like some insolent flunkey   boasting of his master the General’s decorations, “can you imagine that Zverkov will let us   pay alone? He will accept from delicacy, but he will order half a dozen bottles of   champagne.”  “Do we want half a dozen for the four of us?” observed Trudolyubov, taking notice only of   the half dozen.   “So the three of us, with Zverkov for the fourth, twenty-one roubles, at the Hôtel de Paris at   five o’clock to-morrow,” Simonov, who had been asked to make the arrangements,  concluded finally.   “How twenty-one roubles?” I asked in some agitation, with a show of being offended; “if you  count me it will not be twenty-one, but twenty-eight roubles.”  59",
    " It seemed to me that to invite myself so suddenly and unexpectedly would be positively   graceful, and that they would all be conquered at once and would look at me with respect.   “Do you want to join, too?” Simonov observed, with no appearance of pleasure, seeming to   avoid looking at me. He knew me through and through.   It infuriated me that he knew me so thoroughly.   “Why not? I am an old schoolfellow of his, too, I believe, and I must own I feel hurt that you   have left me out,” I said, boiling over again.  “And where were we to find you?” Ferfitchkin put in roughly.   “You never were on good terms with Zverkov,” Trudolyubov added, frowning.   But I had already clutched at the idea and would not give it up.   “It seems to me that no one has a right to form an opinion upon that,” I retorted in a shaking   voice, as though something tremendous had happened. “Perhaps that is just my reason for   wishing it now, that I have not always been on good terms with him.”   “Oh, there’s no making you out ... with these refinements,” Trudolyubov jeered.   “We’ll put your name down,” Simonov decided, addressing me. “To-morrow at five o’clock  at the Hôtel de Paris.”  “What about the money?” Ferfitchkin began in an undertone, indicating me to Simonov, but   he broke off, for even Simonov was embarrassed.   “That will do,” said Trudolyubov, getting up. “If he wants to come so much, let him.”  “But it’s a private thing, between us friends,” Ferfitchkin said crossly, as he, too, picked up  his hat. “It’s not an official gathering.”  “We do not want at all, perhaps....”   They went away. Ferfitchkin did not greet me in any way as he went out, Trudolyubov barely   nodded. Simonov, with whom I was left  tête-à-tête , was in a state of vexation and perplexity,  and looked at me queerly. He did not sit down and did not ask me to.   “H’m ... yes ... to-morrow, then. Will you pay your subscription now? I just ask so as to   know,” he muttered in embarrassment.  I flushed crimson, and as I did so I remembered that I had owed Simonov fifteen roubles for   ages—which I had, indeed, never forgotten, though I had not paid it.  “You will understand, Simonov, that I could have no idea when I came here.... I am very   much vexed that I have forgotten....”   “All right, all right, that doesn’t matter. You can pay to-morrow after the dinner. I simply  wanted to know.... Please don’t....”   He broke off and began pacing the room still more vexed. As he walked he began to stamp   with his heels.  “Am I keeping you?” I asked, after two minutes of silence.   “Oh!” he said, starting, “that is—to be truthful—yes. I have to go and see some one ... not far  from here,” he added in an apologetic voice, somewhat abashed.  “My goodness, why didn’t you say so?” I cried, seizing my cap, with an astonishingly free-  and-easy air, which was the last thing I should have expected of myself.  60",
    " “It’s close by ... not two paces away,” Simonov repeated, accompanying me to the front door  with a fussy air which did not suit him at all. “So five o’clock, punctually, to-morrow,” he  called down the stairs after me. He was very glad to get rid of me. I was in a fury.   “What possessed me, what possessed me to force myself upon them?” I wondered, grinding   my teeth as I strode along the street, “for a scoundrel, a pig like that Zverkov! Of course, I   had better not go; of course, I must just snap my fingers at them. I am not bound in any way.   I’ll send Simonov a note by to-morrow’s post....”  But what made me furious was that I knew for certain that I should go, that I should make a   point of going; and the more tactless, the more unseemly my going would be, the more   certainly I would go.   And there was a positive obstacle to my going: I had no money. All I had was nine roubles, I   had to give seven of that to my servant, Apollon, for his monthly wages. That was all I paid   him—he had to keep himself.   Not to pay him was impossible, considering his character. But I will talk about that fellow,   about that plague of mine, another time.   However, I knew I should go and should not pay him his wages.   That night I had the most hideous dreams. No wonder; all the evening I had been oppressed   by memories of my miserable days at school, and I could not shake them off. I was sent to the   school by distant relations, upon whom I was dependent and of whom I have heard nothing   since—they sent me there a forlorn, silent boy, already crushed by their reproaches, already   troubled by doubt, and looking with savage distrust at every one. My schoolfellows met me   with spiteful and merciless jibes because I was not like any of them. But I could not endure   their taunts; I could not give in to them with the ignoble readiness with which they gave in to   one another. I hated them from the first, and shut myself away from every one in timid,   wounded and disproportionate pride. Their coarseness revolted me. They laughed cynically at   my face, at my clumsy figure; and yet what stupid faces they had themselves. In our school   the boys’ faces seemed in a special way to degenerate and grow stupider. How many fine-  looking boys came to us! In a few years they became repulsive. Even at sixteen I wondered at   them morosely; even then I was struck by the pettiness of their thoughts, the stupidity of their   pursuits, their games, their conversations. They had no understanding of such essential things,   they took no interest in such striking, impressive subjects, that I could not help considering   them inferior to myself. It was not wounded vanity that drove me to it, and for God’s sake do  not thrust upon me your hackneyed remarks, repeated to nausea, that “I was only a dreamer,”   while they even then had an understanding of life. They understood nothing, they had no idea   of real life, and I swear that that was what made me most indignant with them. On the   contrary, the most obvious, striking reality they accepted with fantastic stupidity and even at   that time were accustomed to respect success. Everything that was just, but oppressed and   looked down upon, they laughed at heartlessly and shamefully. They took rank for   intelligence; even at sixteen they were already talking about a snug berth. Of course, a great  deal of it was due to their stupidity, to the bad examples with which they had always been   surrounded in their childhood and boyhood. They were monstrously depraved. Of course a   great deal of that, too, was superficial and an assumption of cynicism; of course there were   glimpses of youth and freshness even in their depravity; but even that freshness was not   attractive, and showed itself in a certain rakishness. I hated them horribly, though perhaps I   was worse than any of them. They repaid me in the same way, and did not conceal their  aversion for me. But by then I did not desire their affection: on the contrary I continually   longed for their humiliation. To escape from their derision I purposely began to make all the  61",
    " progress I could with my studies and forced my way to the very top. This impressed them.   Moreover, they all began by degrees to grasp that I had already read books none of them   could read, and understood things (not forming part of our school curriculum) of which they   had not even heard. They took a savage and sarcastic view of it, but were morally impressed,   especially as the teachers began to notice me on those grounds. The mockery ceased, but the   hostility remained, and cold and strained relations became permanent between us. In the end I   could not put up with it: with years a craving for society, for friends, developed in me. I   attempted to get on friendly terms with some of my schoolfellows; but somehow or other my   intimacy with them was always strained and soon ended of itself. Once, indeed, I did have a  friend. But I was already a tyrant at heart; I wanted to exercise unbounded sway over him; I   tried to instil into him a contempt for his surroundings; I required of him a disdainful and   complete break with those surroundings. I frightened him with my passionate affection; I  reduced him to tears, to hysterics. He was a simple and devoted soul; but when he devoted   himself to me entirely I began to hate him immediately and repulsed him—as though all I   needed him for was to win a victory over him, to subjugate him and nothing else. But I could   not subjugate all of them; my friend was not at all like them either, he was, in fact, a rare   exception. The first thing I did on leaving school was to give up the special job for which I   had been destined so as to break all ties, to curse my past and shake the dust from off my   feet.... And goodness knows why, after all that, I should go trudging off to Simonov’s!  Early next morning I roused myself and jumped out of bed with excitement, as though it were   all about to happen at once. But I believed that some radical change in my life was coming,   and would inevitably come that day. Owing to its rarity, perhaps, any external event, however   trivial, always made me feel as though some radical change in my life were at hand. I went to   the office, however, as usual, but sneaked away home two hours earlier to get ready. The   great thing, I thought, is not to be the first to arrive, or they will think I am overjoyed at   coming. But there were thousands of such great points to consider, and they all agitated and   overwhelmed me. I polished my boots a second time with my own hands; nothing in the   world would have induced Apollon to clean them twice a day, as he considered that it was   more than his duties required of him. I stole the brushes to clean them from the passage,   being careful he should not detect it, for fear of his contempt. Then I minutely examined my   clothes and thought that everything looked old, worn and threadbare. I had let myself get too   slovenly. My uniform, perhaps, was tidy, but I could not go out to dinner in my uniform. The   worst of it was that on the knee of my trousers was a big yellow stain. I had a foreboding that   that stain would deprive me of nine-tenths of my personal dignity. I knew, too, that it was   very poor to think so. “But this is no time for thinking: now I am in for the real thing,” I  thought, and my heart sank. I knew, too, perfectly well even then, that I was monstrously   exaggerating the facts. But how could I help it? I could not control myself and was already   shaking with fever. With despair I pictured to myself how coldly and disdainfully that   “scoundrel” Zverkov would meet me; with what dull-witted, invincible contempt the  blockhead Trudolyubov would look at me; with what impudent rudeness the insect   Ferfitchkin would snigger at me in order to curry favour with Zverkov; how completely   Simonov would take it all in, and how he would despise me for the abjectness of my vanity   and lack of spirit—and, worst of all, how paltry,  unliterary , commonplace it would all be. Of  course, the best thing would be not to go at all. But that was most impossible of all: if I feel   impelled to do anything, I seem to be pitchforked into it. I should have jeered at myself ever   afterwards: “So you funked it, you funked it, you funked the  real thing !” On the contrary, I   passionately longed to show all that “rabble” that I was by no means such a spiritless creature   as I seemed to myself. What is more, even in the acutest paroxysm of this cowardly fever, I   dreamed of getting the upper hand, of dominating them, carrying them away, making them   like me—if only for my “elevation of thought and unmistakable wit.” They would abandon  62",
    " Zverkov, he would sit on one side, silent and ashamed, while I should crush him. Then,   perhaps, we would be reconciled and drink to our everlasting friendship; but what was most   bitter and most humiliating for me was that I knew even then, knew fully and for certain, that   I needed nothing of all this really, that I did not really want to crush, to subdue, to attract   them, and that I did not care a straw really for the result, even if I did achieve it. Oh, how I   prayed for the day to pass quickly! In unutterable anguish I went to the window, opened the   movable pane and looked out into the troubled darkness of the thickly falling wet snow. At   last my wretched little clock hissed out five. I seized my hat and trying not to look at   Apollon, who had been all day expecting his month’s wages, but in his foolishness was   unwilling to be the first to speak about it, I slipt between him and the door and jumping into a   high-class sledge, on which I spent my last half rouble, I drove up in grand style to the Hôtel   de Paris.  IV  I had been certain the day before that I should be the first to arrive. But it was not a question   of being the first to arrive. Not only were they not there, but I had difficulty in finding our   room. The table was not laid even. What did it mean? After a good many questions I elicited   from the waiters that the dinner had been ordered not for five, but for six o’clock. This was   confirmed at the buffet too. I felt really ashamed to go on questioning them. It was only   twenty-five minutes past five. If they changed the dinner hour they ought at least to have let  me know—that is what the post is for, and not to have put me in an absurd position in my   own eyes and ... and even before the waiters. I sat down; the servant began laying the table; I   felt even more humiliated when he was present. Towards six o’clock they brought in candles,   though there were lamps burning in the room. It had not occurred to the waiter, however, to   bring them in at once when I arrived. In the next room two gloomy, angry-looking persons   were eating their dinners in silence at two different tables. There was a great deal of noise,   even shouting, in a room further away; one could hear the laughter of a crowd of people, and   nasty little shrieks in French: there were ladies at the dinner. It was sickening, in fact. I rarely   passed more unpleasant moments, so much so that when they did arrive all together   punctually at six I was overjoyed to see them, as though they were my deliverers, and even   forgot that it was incumbent upon me to show resentment.   Zverkov walked in at the head of them; evidently he was the leading spirit. He and all of   them were laughing; but, seeing me, Zverkov drew himself up a little, walked up to me   deliberately with a slight, rather jaunty bend from the waist. He shook hands with me in a  friendly, but not over-friendly, fashion, with a sort of circumspect courtesy like that of a   General, as though in giving me his hand he were warding off something. I had imagined, on   the contrary, that on coming in he would at once break into his habitual thin, shrill laugh and   fall to making his insipid jokes and witticisms. I had been preparing for them ever since the   previous day, but I had not expected such condescension, such high-official courtesy. So,   then, he felt himself ineffably superior to me in every respect! If he only meant to insult me   by that high-official tone, it would not matter, I thought—I could pay him back for it one way   or another. But what if, in reality, without the least desire to be offensive, that sheepshead had   a notion in earnest that he was superior to me and could only look at me in a patronizing  way? The very supposition made me gasp.   “I was surprised to hear of your desire to join us,” he began, lisping and drawling, which was   something new. “You and I seem to have seen nothing of one another. You fight shy of us.   You shouldn’t. We are not such terrible people as you think. Well, anyway, I am glad to   renew our acquaintance.”  And he turned carelessly to put down his hat on the window.  63",
    " “Have you been waiting long?” Trudolyubov inquired.   “I arrived at five o’clock as you told me yesterday,” I answered aloud, with an irritability that  threatened an explosion.   “Didn’t you let him know that we had changed the hour?” said Trudolyubov to Simonov.  “No, I didn’t. I forgot,” the latter replied, with no sign of regret, and without even   apologizing to me he went off to order the  hors d’œuvres .  “So you’ve been here a whole hour? Oh, poor fellow!” Zverkov cried ironically, for to his   notions this was bound to be extremely funny. That rascal Ferfitchkin followed with his nasty   little snigger like a puppy yapping. My position struck him, too, as exquisitely ludicrous and   embarrassing.  “It isn’t funny at all!” I cried to Ferfitchkin, more and more irritated. “It wasn’t my fault, but  other people’s. They neglected to let me know. It was ... it was ... it was simply absurd.”   “It’s not only absurd, but something else as well,” muttered Trudolyubov, naïvely taking my  part. “You are not hard enough upon it. It was simply rudeness—unintentional, of course.   And how could Simonov ... h’m!”  “If a trick like that had been played on me,” observed Ferfitchkin, “I should....”   “But you should have ordered something for yourself,” Zverkov interrupted, “or simply asked   for dinner without waiting for us.”   “You will allow that I might have done that without your permission,” I rapped out. “If I  waited, it was....”   “Let us sit down, gentlemen,” cried Simonov, coming in. “Everything is ready; I can answer   for the champagne; it is capitally frozen.... You see, I did not know your address, where was I   to look for you?” he suddenly turned to me, but again he seemed to avoid looking at me.   Evidently he had something against me. It must have been what happened yesterday.   All sat down; I did the same. It was a round table. Trudolyubov was on my left, Simonov on   my right. Zverkov was sitting opposite, Ferfitchkin next to him, between him and   Trudolyubov.   “Tell me, are you ... in a government office?” Zverkov went on attending to me. Seeing that I   was embarrassed he seriously thought that he ought to be friendly to me, and, so to speak,   cheer me up.  “Does he want me to throw a bottle at his head?” I thought, in a fury. In my novel   surroundings I was unnaturally ready to be irritated.   “In the N—— office,” I answered jerkily, with my eyes on my plate.  “And ha-ave you a go-od berth? I say, what ma-a-de you leave your original job?”   “What ma-a-de me was that I wanted to leave my original job,” I drawled more than he,  hardly able to control myself. Ferfitchkin went off into a guffaw. Simonov looked at me   ironically. Trudolyubov left off eating and began looking at me with curiosity.   Zverkov winced, but he tried not to notice it.   “And the remuneration?”   “What remuneration?”  “I mean, your sa-a-lary?”  64",
    " “Why are you cross-examining me?” However, I told him at once what my salary was. I  turned horribly red.   “It is not very handsome,” Zverkov observed majestically.   “Yes, you can’t afford to dine at cafés on that,” Ferfitchkin added insolently.   “To my thinking it’s very poor,” Trudolyubov observed gravely.   “And how thin you have grown! How you have changed!” added Zverkov, with a shade of   venom in his voice, scanning me and my attire with a sort of insolent compassion.   “Oh, spare his blushes,” cried Ferfitchkin, sniggering.   “My dear sir, allow me to tell you I am not blushing,” I broke out at last; “do you hear? I am   dining here, at this café, at my own expense, not at other people’s—note that, Mr.   Ferfitchkin.”   “Wha-at? Isn’t every one here dining at his own expense? You would seem to be....”  Ferfitchkin flew out at me, turning as red as a lobster, and looking me in the face with fury.   “Tha-at,” I answered, feeling I had gone too far, “and I imagine it would be better to talk of  something more intelligent.”  “You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?”   “Don’t disturb yourself, that would be quite out of place here.”  “Why are you clacking away like that, my good sir, eh? Have you gone out of your wits in   your office?”   “Enough, gentlemen, enough!” Zverkov cried, authoritatively.   “How stupid it is!” muttered Simonov.  “It really is stupid. We have met here, a company of friends, for a farewell dinner to a   comrade and you carry on an altercation,” said Trudolyubov, rudely addressing himself to me   alone. “You invited yourself to join us, so don’t disturb the general harmony.”   “Enough, enough!” cried Zverkov. “Give over, gentlemen, it’s out of place. Better let me tell  you how I nearly got married the day before yesterday....”   And then followed a burlesque narrative of how this gentleman had almost been married two   days before. There was not a word about the marriage, however, but the story was adorned   with generals, colonels and kammer-junkers, while Zverkov almost took the lead among   them. It was greeted with approving laughter; Ferfitchkin positively squealed.   No one paid any attention to me, and I sat crushed and humiliated.   “Good Heavens, these are not the people for me!” I thought. “And what a fool I have made of   myself before them! I let Ferfitchkin go too far, though. The brutes imagine they are doing   me an honour in letting me sit down with them. They don’t understand that it’s an honour to   them and not to me! I’ve grown thinner! My clothes! Oh, damn my trousers! Zverkov noticed   the yellow stain on the knee as soon as he came in.... But what’s the use! I must get up at   once, this very minute, take my hat and simply go without a word ... with contempt! And to-  morrow I can send a challenge. The scoundrels! As though I cared about the seven roubles.   They may think.... Damn it! I don’t care about the seven roubles. I’ll go this minute!”  Of course I remained. I drank sherry and Lafitte by the glassful in my discomfiture. Being   unaccustomed to it, I was quickly affected. My annoyance increased as the wine went to my   head. I longed all at once to insult them all in a most flagrant manner and then go away. To  65",
    " seize the moment and show what I could do, so that they would say, “He’s clever, though he  is absurd,” and ... and ... in fact, damn them all!   I scanned them all insolently with my drowsy eyes. But they seemed to have forgotten me   altogether. They were noisy, vociferous, cheerful. Zverkov was talking all the time. I began   listening. Zverkov was talking of some exuberant lady whom he had at last led on to   declaring her love (of course, he was lying like a horse), and how he had been helped in this   affair by an intimate friend of his, a Prince Kolya, an officer in the hussars, who had three   thousand serfs.   “And yet this Kolya, who has three thousand serfs, has not put in an appearance here to-night   to see you off,” I cut in suddenly.   For a minute every one was silent. “You are drunk already.” Trudolyubov deigned to notice   me at last, glancing contemptuously in my direction. Zverkov, without a word, examined me   as though I were an insect. I dropped my eyes. Simonov made haste to fill up the glasses with   champagne.  Trudolyubov raised his glass, as did every one else but me.   “Your health and good luck on the journey!” he cried to Zverkov. “To old times, to our   future, hurrah!”   They all tossed off their glasses, and crowded round Zverkov to kiss him. I did not move; my   full glass stood untouched before me.   “Why, aren’t you going to drink it?” roared Trudolyubov, losing patience and turning  menacingly to me.   “I want to make a speech separately, on my own account ... and then I’ll drink it, Mr.   Trudolyubov.”   “Spiteful brute!” muttered Simonov. I drew myself up in my chair and feverishly seized my   glass, prepared for something extraordinary, though I did not know myself precisely what I   was going to say.   “ Silence! ” cried Ferfitchkin. “Now for a display of wit!”  Zverkov waited very gravely, knowing what was coming.   “Mr. Lieutenant Zverkov,” I began, “let me tell you that I hate phrases, phrasemongers and   men in corsets ... that’s the first point, and there is a second one to follow it.”   There was a general stir.  “The second point is: I hate ribaldry and ribald talkers. Especially ribald talkers! The third   point: I love justice, truth and honesty.” I went on almost mechanically, for I was beginning   to shiver with horror myself and had no idea how I came to be talking like this. “I love  thought, Monsieur Zverkov; I love true comradeship, on an equal footing and not.... H’m ... I   love.... But, however, why not? I will drink your health, too, Mr. Zverkov. Seduce the   Circassian girls, shoot the enemies of the fatherland and ... and ... to your health, Monsieur   Zverkov!”   Zverkov got up from his seat, bowed to me and said:   “I am very much obliged to you.” He was frightfully offended and turned pale.   “Damn the fellow!” roared Trudolyubov, bringing his fist down on the table.  “Well, he wants a punch in the face for that,” squealed Ferfitchkin.  66",
    " “We ought to turn him out,” muttered Simonov.   “Not a word, gentlemen, not a movement!” cried Zverkov solemnly, checking the general   indignation. “I thank you all, but I can show him for myself how much value I attach to his   words.”   “Mr. Ferfitchkin, you will give me satisfaction to-morrow for your words just now!” I said  aloud, turning with dignity to Ferfitchkin.   “A duel, you mean? Certainly,” he answered. But probably I was so ridiculous as I   challenged him and it was so out of keeping with my appearance that everyone, including   Ferfitchkin, was prostrate with laughter.   “Yes, let him alone, of course! He is quite drunk,” Trudolyubov said with disgust.   “I shall never forgive myself for letting him join us,” Simonov muttered again.   “Now is the time to throw a bottle at their heads,” I thought to myself. I picked up the bottle  ... and filled my glass.... “No, I’d better sit on to the end,” I went on thinking; “you would be  pleased, my friends if I went away. Nothing will induce me to go. I’ll go on sitting here and   drinking to the end, on purpose, as a sign that I don’t think you of the slightest consequence. I   will go on sitting and drinking, because this is a public-house and I paid my entrance money.   I’ll sit here and drink, for I look upon you as so many pawns, as inanimate pawns. I’ll sit here  and drink ... and sing if I want to, yes, sing, for I have the right to ... to sing.... H’m!”  But I did not sing. I simply tried not to look at any of them. I assumed most unconcerned   attitudes and waited with impatience for them to speak  first . But alas, they did not address  me! And oh, how I wished, how I wished at that moment to be reconciled to them! It struck   eight, at last nine. They moved from the table to the sofa. Zverkov stretched himself on a   lounge and put one foot on a round table. Wine was brought there. He did, as a fact, order   three bottles on his own account. I, of course, was not invited to join them. They all sat round   him on the sofa. They listened to him, almost with reverence. It was evident that they were   fond of him. “What for? What for?” I wondered. From time to time they were moved to  drunken enthusiasm and kissed each other. They talked of the Caucasus, of the nature of true   passion, of snug berths in the service, of the income of an hussar called Podharzhevsky,   whom none of them knew personally, and rejoiced in the largeness of it, of the extraordinary   grace and beauty of a Princess D., whom none of them had ever seen; then it came to   Shakespeare’s being immortal.  I smiled contemptuously and walked up and down the other side of the room, opposite the   sofa, from the table to the stove and back again. I tried my very utmost to show them that I   could do without them, and yet I purposely made a noise with my boots, thumping with my   heels. But it was all in vain. They paid no attention. I had the patience to walk up and down   in front of them from eight o’clock till eleven, in the same place, from the table to the stove   and back again. “I walk up and down to please myself and no one can prevent me.” The   waiter who came into the room stopped, from time to time, to look at me. I was somewhat   giddy from turning round so often; at moments it seemed to me that I was in delirium. During   those three hours I was three times soaked with sweat and dry again. At times, with an  intense, acute pang I was stabbed to the heart by the thought that ten years, twenty years,   forty years would pass, and that even in forty years I would remember with loathing and   humiliation those filthiest, most ludicrous, and most awful moments of my life. No one could   have gone out of his way to degrade himself more shamelessly, and I fully realized it, fully,   and yet I went on pacing up and down from the table to the stove. “Oh, if you only knew   what thoughts and feelings I am capable of, how cultured I am!” I thought at moments,   mentally addressing the sofa on which my enemies were sitting. But my enemies behaved as  67",
    " though I were not in the room. Once—only once—they turned towards me, just when   Zverkov was talking about Shakespeare, and I suddenly gave a contemptuous laugh. I   laughed in such an affected and disgusting way that they all at once broke off their   conversation, and silently and gravely for two minutes watched me walking up and down   from the table to the stove,  taking no notice of them . But nothing came of it: they said  nothing, and two minutes later they ceased to notice me again. It struck eleven.   “Friends,” cried Zverkov getting up from the sofa, “let us all be off now,  there !”   “Of course, of course,” the others assented. I turned sharply to Zverkov. I was so harassed, so   exhausted, that I would have cut my throat to put an end to it. I was in a fever; my hair,   soaked with perspiration, stuck to my forehead and temples.   “Zverkov, I beg your pardon,” I said abruptly and resolutely. “Ferfitchkin, yours too, and   every one’s, every one’s: I have insulted you all!”   “Aha! A duel is not in your line, old man,” Ferfitchkin hissed venomously.   It sent a sharp pang to my heart.   “No, it’s not the duel I am afraid of, Ferfitchkin! I am ready to fight you to-morrow, after we  are reconciled. I insist upon it, in fact, and you cannot refuse. I want to show you that I am   not afraid of a duel. You shall fire first and I shall fire into the air.”   “He is comforting himself,” said Simonov.  “He’s simply raving,” said Trudolyubov.  “But let us pass. Why are you barring our way? What do you want?” Zverkov answered   disdainfully.   They were all flushed; their eyes were bright: they had been drinking heavily.   “I ask for your friendship, Zverkov; I insulted you, but....”   “Insulted?  You  insulted  me ? Understand, sir, that you never, under any circumstances, could  possibly insult  me .”  “And that’s enough for you. Out of the way!” concluded Trudolyubov.   “Olympia is mine, friends, that’s agreed!” cried Zverkov.  “We won’t dispute your right, we won’t dispute your right,” the others answered, laughing.  I stood as though spat upon. The party went noisily out of the room. Trudolyubov struck up   some stupid song. Simonov remained behind for a moment to tip the waiters. I suddenly went   up to him.   “Simonov! give me six roubles!” I said, with desperate resolution.   He looked at me in extreme amazement, with vacant eyes. He, too, was drunk.   “You don’t mean you are coming with us?”   “Yes.”  “I’ve no money,” he snapped out, and with a scornful laugh he went out of the room.   I clutched at his overcoat. It was a nightmare.   “Simonov, I saw you had money. Why do you refuse me? Am I a scoundrel? Beware of  refusing me: if you knew, if you knew why I am asking! My whole future, my whole plans   depend upon it!”  68",
    " Simonov pulled out the money and almost flung it at me.   “Take it, if you have no sense of shame!” he pronounced pitilessly, and ran to overtake them.   I was left for a moment alone. Disorder, the remains of dinner, a broken wine-glass on the   floor, spilt wine, cigarette ends, fumes of drink and delirium in my brain, an agonizing misery   in my heart and finally the waiter, who had seen and heard all and was looking inquisitively   into my face.  “I am going there!” I cried. “Either they shall all go down on their knees to beg for my  friendship, or I will give Zverkov a slap in the face!”   V   “So this is it, this is it at last—contact with real life,” I muttered as I ran headlong downstairs.  “This is very different from the Pope’s leaving Rome and going to Brazil, very different from   the ball on Lake Como!”   “You are a scoundrel,” a thought flashed through my mind, “if you laugh at this now.”  “No matter!” I cried, answering myself. “Now everything is lost!”  There was no trace to be seen of them, but that made no difference—I knew where they had   gone.   At the steps was standing a solitary night sledge-driver in a rough peasant coat, powdered   over with the still falling, wet, and as it were warm, snow. It was hot and steamy. The little   shaggy piebald horse was also covered with snow and coughing, I remember that very well. I  made a rush for the roughly made sledge; but as soon as I raised my foot to get into it, the   recollection of how Simonov had just given me six roubles seemed to double me up and I   tumbled into the sledge like a sack.   “No, I must do a great deal to make up for all that,” I cried. “But I will make up for it or  perish on the spot this very night. Start!”   We set off. There was a perfect whirl in my head.  “They won’t go down on their knees to beg for my friendship. That is a mirage, cheap   mirage, revolting, romantic and fantastical—that’s another ball on Lake Como. And so I am  bound to slap Zverkov’s face! It is my duty to. And so it is settled; I am flying to give him a  slap in the face. Hurry up!”   The driver tugged at the reins.   “As soon as I go in I’ll give it him. Ought I before giving him the slap to say a few words by   way of preface? No. I’ll simply go in and give it him. They will all be sitting in the drawing- room, and he with Olympia on the sofa. That damned Olympia! She laughed at my looks on   one occasion and refused me. I’ll pull Olympia’s hair, pull Zverkov’s ears! No, better one  ear, and pull him by it round the room. Maybe they will all begin beating me and will kick   me out. That’s most likely, indeed. No matter! Anyway, I shall first slap him; the initiative  will be mine; and by the laws of honour that is everything: he will be branded and cannot   wipe off the slap by any blows, by nothing but a duel. He will be forced to fight. And let   them beat me now. Let them, the ungrateful wretches! Trudolyubov will beat me hardest, he   is so strong; Ferfitchkin will be sure to catch hold sideways and tug at my hair. But no matter,   no matter! That’s what I am going for. The blockheads will be forced at last to see the  tragedy of it all! When they drag me to the door I shall call out to them that in reality they are   not worth my little finger. Get on, driver, get on!” I cried to the driver. He started and flicked  his whip, I shouted so savagely.  69",
    " “We shall fight at daybreak, that’s a settled thing. I’ve done with the office. Ferfitchkin made   a joke about it just now. But where can I get pistols? Nonsense! I’ll get my salary in advance  and buy them. And powder, and bullets? That’s the second’s business. And how can it all be  done by daybreak? And where am I to get a second? I have no friends. Nonsense!” I cried,  lashing myself up more and more. “It’s of no consequence! the first person I meet in the  street is bound to be my second, just as he would be bound to pull a drowning man out of   water. The most eccentric things may happen. Even if I were to ask the director himself to be   my second to-morrow, he would be bound to consent, if only from a feeling of chivalry, and   to keep the secret! Anton Antonitch....”   The fact is, that at that very minute the disgusting absurdity of my plan and the other side of   the question was clearer and more vivid to my imagination than it could be to any one on   earth. But....   “Get on, driver, get on, you rascal, get on!”   “Ugh, sir!” said the son of toil.   Cold shivers suddenly ran down me. Wouldn’t it be better ... to go straight home? My God,   my God! Why did I invite myself to this dinner yesterday? But no, it’s impossible. And my   walking up and down for three hours from the table to the stove? No, they, they and no one   else must pay for my walking up and down! They must wipe out this dishonour! Drive on!   And what if they give me into custody? They won’t dare! They’ll be afraid of the scandal.  And what if Zverkov is so contemptuous that he refuses to fight a duel? He is sure to; but in   that case I’ll show them ... I will turn up at the posting station when he is setting off to- morrow, I’ll catch him by the leg, I’ll pull off his coat when he gets into the carriage. I’ll get  my teeth into his hand, I’ll bite him. “See what lengths you can drive a desperate man to!” He  may hit me on the head and they may belabour me from behind. I will shout to the assembled   multitude: “Look at this young puppy who is driving off to captivate the Circassian girls after   letting me spit in his face!”  Of course, after that everything will be over! The office will have vanished off the face of the   earth. I shall be arrested, I shall be tried, I shall be dismissed from the service, thrown in   prison, sent to Siberia. Never mind! In fifteen years when they let me out of prison I will   trudge off to him, a beggar, in rags. I shall find him in some provincial town. He will be   married and happy. He will have a grown-up daughter.... I shall say to him: “Look, monster,   at my hollow cheeks and my rags! I’ve lost everything—my career, my happiness, art,   science,  the woman I loved , and all through you. Here are pistols. I have come to discharge  my pistol and ... and I ... forgive you. Then I shall fire into the air and he will hear nothing   more of me....”   I was actually on the point of tears, though I knew perfectly well at that moment that all this   was out of Pushkin’s  Silvio  and Lermontov’s  Masquerade . And all at once I felt horribly  ashamed, so ashamed that I stopped the horse, got out of the sledge, and stood still in the   snow in the middle of the street. The driver gazed at me, sighing and astonished.   What was I to do? I could not go on there—it was evidently stupid, and I could not leave   things as they were, because that would seem as though.... Heavens, how could I leave   things! And after such insults! “No!” I cried, throwing myself into the sledge again. “It is  ordained! It is fate! Drive on, drive on!”   And in my impatience I punched the sledge-driver on the back of the neck.   “What are you up to? What are you hitting me for?” the peasant shouted, but he whipped up   his nag so that it began kicking.  70",
    " The wet snow was falling in big flakes; I unbuttoned myself, regardless of it. I forgot   everything else, for I had finally decided on the slap, and felt with horror that it was going to   happen  now, at once , and that  no force could stop it . The deserted street lamps gleamed  sullenly in the snowy darkness like torches at a funeral. The snow drifted under my great-  coat, under my coat, under my cravat, and melted there. I did not wrap myself up—all was   lost, anyway.   At last we arrived. I jumped out, almost unconscious, ran up the steps and began knocking   and kicking at the door. I felt fearfully weak, particularly in my legs and my knees. The door   was opened quickly as though they knew I was coming. As a fact, Simonov had warned them   that perhaps another gentleman would arrive, and this was a place in which one had to give   notice and to observe certain precautions. It was one of those “millinery establishments”  which were abolished by the police a good time ago. By day it really was a shop; but at night,   if one had an introduction, one might visit it for other purposes.   I walked rapidly through the dark shop into the familiar drawing-room, where there was only   one candle burning, and stood still in amazement: there was no one there. “Where are they?”  I asked somebody. But by now, of course, they had separated. Before me was standing a   person with a stupid smile, the “madam” herself, who had seen me before. A minute later a  door opened and another person came in.   Taking no notice of anything I strode about the room, and, I believe, I talked to myself. I felt   as though I had been saved from death and was conscious of this, joyfully, all over: I should   have given that slap, I should certainly, certainly have given it! But now they were not here   and ... everything had vanished and changed! I looked round. I could not realize my condition   yet. I looked mechanically at the girl who had come in: and had a glimpse of a fresh, young,   rather pale face, with straight, dark eyebrows, and with grave, as it were wondering, eyes that  attracted me at once; I should have hated her if she had been smiling. I began looking at her   more intently and, as it were, with effort. I had not fully collected my thoughts. There was   something simple and good-natured in her face, but something strangely grave. I am sure that   this stood in her way here, and no one of those fools had noticed her. She could not, however,   have been called a beauty, though she was tall, strong-looking, and well built. She was very  simply dressed. Something loathsome stirred within me. I went straight up to her.   I chanced to look into the glass. My harassed face struck me as revolting in the extreme, pale,   angry, abject, with dishevelled hair. “No matter, I am glad of it,” I thought; “I am glad that I  shall seem repulsive to her; I like that.”  VI  ... Somewhere behind a screen a clock began wheezing, as though oppressed by something,   as though some one were strangling it. After an unnaturally prolonged wheezing there   followed a shrill, nasty, and as it were unexpectedly rapid, chime—as though some one were   suddenly jumping forward. It struck two. I woke up, though I had indeed not been asleep but   lying half conscious.   It was almost completely dark in the narrow, cramped, low-pitched room, cumbered up with   an enormous wardrobe and piles of cardboard boxes and all sorts of frippery and litter. The   candle end that had been burning on the table was going out and gave a faint flicker from  time to time. In a few minutes there would be complete darkness.  I was not long in coming to myself; everything came back to my mind at once, without an   effort, as though it had been in ambush to pounce upon me again. And, indeed, even while I   was unconscious a point seemed continually to remain in my memory unforgotten, and round   it my dreams moved drearily. But strange to say, everything that had happened to me in that  71",
    " day seemed to me now, on waking, to be in the far, far away past, as though I had long, long   ago lived all that down.   My head was full of fumes. Something seemed to be hovering over me, rousing me, exciting   me, and making me restless. Misery and spite seemed surging up in me again and seeking an   outlet. Suddenly I saw beside me two wide open eyes scrutinizing me curiously and   persistently. The look in those eyes was coldly detached, sullen, as it were utterly remote; it   weighed upon me.   A grim idea came into my brain and passed all over my body, as a horrible sensation, such as   one feels when one goes into a damp and mouldy cellar. There was something unnatural in   those two eyes, beginning to look at me only now. I recalled, too, that during those two hours   I had not said a single word to this creature, and had, in fact, considered it utterly superfluous;   in fact, the silence had for some reason gratified me. Now I suddenly realized vividly the   hideous idea—revolting as a spider—of vice, which, without love, grossly and shamelessly   begins with that in which true love finds its consummation. For a long time we gazed at each   other like that, but she did not drop her eyes before mine and her expression did not change,   so that at last I felt uncomfortable.  “What is your name?” I asked abruptly, to put an end to it.   “Liza,” she answered almost in a whisper, but somehow far from graciously, and she turned  her eyes away.  I was silent.  “What weather! The snow ... it’s disgusting!” I said, almost to myself, putting my arm under   my head despondently, and gazing at the ceiling.   She made no answer. This was horrible.   “Have you always lived in Petersburg?” I asked a minute later, almost angrily, turning my   head slightly towards her.   “No.”  “Where do you come from?”   “From Riga,” she answered reluctantly.  “Are you a German?”   “No, Russian.”   “Have you been here long?”   “Where?”  “In this house?”   “A fortnight.”   She spoke more and more jerkily. The candle went out; I could no longer distinguish her face.   “Have you a father and mother?”   “Yes ... no ... I have.”   “Where are they?”  “There ... in Riga.”   “What are they?”  72",
    " “Oh, nothing.”   “Nothing? Why, what class are they?”   “Tradespeople.”  “Have you always lived with them?”   “Yes.”  “How old are you?”   “Twenty.”   “Why did you leave them?”   “Oh, for no reason.”   That answer meant “Let me alone; I feel sick, sad.”  We were silent.  God knows why I did not go away. I felt myself more and more sick and dreary. The images   of the previous day began of themselves, apart from my will, flitting through my memory in   confusion. I suddenly recalled something I had seen that morning when, full of anxious   thoughts, I was hurrying to the office.   “I saw them carrying a coffin out yesterday and they nearly dropped it,” I suddenly said   aloud, not that I desired to open the conversation, but as it were by accident.   “A coffin?”   “Yes, in the Haymarket; they were bringing it up out of a cellar.”   “From a cellar?”  “Not from a cellar, but from a basement. Oh, you know ... down below ... from a house of ill-  fame. It was filthy all round.... Egg-shells, litter ... a stench. It was loathsome.”   Silence.  “A nasty day to be buried,” I began, simply to avoid being silent.   “Nasty, in what way?”   “The snow, the wet.” (I yawned.)   “It makes no difference,” she said suddenly, after a brief silence.  “No, it’s horrid.” (I yawned again.) “The gravediggers must have sworn at getting drenched   by the snow. And there must have been water in the grave.”   “Why water in the grave?” she asked, with a sort of curiosity, but speaking even more harshly   and abruptly than before.   I suddenly began to feel provoked.   “Why, there must have been water at the bottom a foot deep. You can’t dig a dry grave in   Volkovo Cemetery.”   “Why?”   “Why? Why, the place is waterlogged. It’s a regular marsh. So they bury them in water. I’ve  seen it myself ... many times.”  73",
    " (I had never seen it once, indeed I had never been in Volkovo, and had only heard stories of   it.)  “Do you mean to say, you don’t mind how you die?”   “But why should I die?” she answered, as though defending herself.   “Why, some day you will die, and you will die just the same as that dead woman. She was ...   a girl like you. She died of consumption.”   “A wench would have died in hospital....” (She knows all about it already: she said “wench,”  not “girl.”)  “She was in debt to her madam,” I retorted, more and more provoked by the discussion; “and   went on earning money for her up to the end, though she was in consumption. Some sledge-  drivers standing by were talking about her to some soldiers and telling them so. No doubt   they knew her. They were laughing. They were going to meet in a pot-house to drink to her   memory.”   A great deal of this was my invention. Silence followed, profound silence. She did not stir.   “And is it better to die in a hospital?”  “Isn’t it just the same? Besides, why should I die?” she added irritably.  “If not now, a little later.”  “Why a little later?”  “Why, indeed? Now you are young, pretty, fresh, you fetch a high price. But after another   year of this life you will be very different—you will go off.”   “In a year?”  “Anyway, in a year you will be worth less,” I continued malignantly. “You will go from here   to something lower, another house; a year later—to a third, lower and lower, and in seven   years you will come to a basement in the Haymarket. That will be if you were lucky. But it   would be much worse if you got some disease, consumption, say ... and caught a chill, or   something or other. It’s not easy to get over an illness in your way of life. If you catch   anything you may not get rid of it. And so you would die.”   “Oh, well, then I shall die,” she answered, quite vindictively, and she made a quick   movement.   “But one is sorry.”   “Sorry for whom?”   “Sorry for life.”  Silence.  “Have you been engaged to be married? Eh?”  “What’s that to you?”  “Oh, I am not cross-examining you. It’s nothing to me. Why are you so cross? Of course you   may have had your own troubles. What is it to me? It’s simply that I felt sorry.”  “Sorry for whom?”   “Sorry for you.”   “No need,” she whispered hardly audibly, and again made a faint movement.  74",
    " That incensed me at once. What! I was so gentle with her, and she....   “Why, do you think that you are on the right path?”   “I don’t think anything.”   “That’s what’s wrong, that you don’t think. Realize it while there is still time. There still is  time. You are still young, good-looking; you might love, be married, be happy....”   “Not all married women are happy,” she snapped out in the rude abrupt tone she had used at   first.  “Not all, of course, but anyway it is much better than the life here. Infinitely better. Besides,   with love one can live even without happiness. Even in sorrow life is sweet; life is sweet,   however one lives. But here what is there but ... foulness. Phew!”   I turned away with disgust; I was no longer reasoning coldly. I began to feel myself what I   was saying and warmed to the subject. I was already longing to expound the cherished ideas I   had brooded over in my corner. Something suddenly flared up in me. An object had appeared  before me.  “Never mind my being here, I am not an example for you. I am, perhaps, worse than you are.   I was drunk when I came here, though,” I hastened, however, to say in self-defence.  “Besides, a man is no example for a woman. It’s a different thing. I may degrade and defile   myself, but I am not any one’s slave. I come and go, and that’s an end of it. I shake it off, and   I am a different man. But you are a slave from the start. Yes, a slave! You give up everything,   your whole freedom. If you want to break your chains afterwards, you won’t be able to: you   will be more and more fast in the snares. It is an accursed bondage. I know it. I won’t speak  of anything else, maybe you won’t understand, but tell me: no doubt you are in debt to your   madam? There, you see,” I added, though she made no answer, but only listened in silence,   entirely absorbed, “that’s a bondage for you! You will never buy your freedom. They will see  to that. It’s like selling your soul to the devil.... And besides ... perhaps I, too, am just as   unlucky—how do you know—and wallow in the mud on purpose, out of misery? You know,   men take to drink from grief; well, maybe I am here from grief. Come, tell me, what is there   good here? Here you and I ... came together ... just now and did not say one word to one   another all the time, and it was only afterwards you began staring at me like a wild creature,   and I at you. Is that loving? Is that how one human being should meet another? It’s hideous,  that’s what it is!”  “Yes!” she assented sharply and hurriedly.  I was positively astounded by the promptitude of this “Yes.” So the same thought may have  been straying through her mind when she was staring at me just before. So she, too, was   capable of certain thoughts? “Damn it all, this was interesting, this was a point of likeness!” I  thought, almost rubbing my hands. And indeed it’s easy to turn a young soul like that!   It was the exercise of my power that attracted me most.  She turned her head nearer to me, and it seemed to me in the darkness that she propped   herself on her arm. Perhaps she was scrutinizing me. How I regretted that I could not see her   eyes. I heard her deep breathing.   “Why have you come here?” I asked her, with a note of authority already in my voice.  “Oh, I don’t know.”   “But how nice it would be to be living in your father’s house! It’s warm and free; you have a  home of your own.”  75",
    " “But what if it’s worse than this?”  “I must take the right tone,” flashed through my mind. “I may not get far with  sentimentality.” But it was only a momentary thought. I swear she really did interest me.  Besides, I was exhausted and moody. And cunning so easily goes hand-in-hand with feeling.  “Who denies it!” I hastened to answer. “Anything may happen. I am convinced that some one  has wronged you, and that you are more sinned against than sinning. Of course, I know   nothing of your story, but it’s not likely a girl like you has come here of her own   inclination....”   “A girl like me?” she whispered, hardly audibly; but I heard it.  Damn it all, I was flattering her. That was horrid. But perhaps it was a good thing.... She was   silent.  “See, Liza, I will tell you about myself. If I had had a home from childhood, I shouldn’t be  what I am now. I often think that. However bad it may be at home, anyway they are your   father and mother, and not enemies, strangers. Once a year at least, they’ll show their love of  you. Anyway, you know you are at home. I grew up without a home; and perhaps that’s why   I’ve turned so ... unfeeling.”   I waited again. “Perhaps she doesn’t understand,” I thought, “and, indeed, it is absurd—it’s  moralizing.”  “If I were a father and had a daughter, I believe I should love my daughter more than my   sons, really,” I began indirectly, as though talking of something else, to distract her attention.   I must confess I blushed.   “Why so?” she asked.  Ah! so she was listening!   “I don’t know, Liza. I knew a father who was a stern, austere man, but used to go down on   his knees to his daughter, used to kiss her hands, her feet, he couldn’t make enough of her,   really. When she danced at parties he used to stand for five hours at a stretch, gazing at her.   He was mad over her: I understand that! She would fall asleep tired at night, and he would   wake to kiss her in her sleep and make the sign of the cross over her. He would go about in a   dirty old coat, he was stingy to every one else, but would spend his last penny for her, giving   her expensive presents, and it was his greatest delight when she was pleased with what he   gave her. Fathers always love their daughters more than the mothers do. Some girls live  happily at home! And I believe I should never let my daughters marry.”   “What next?” she said, with a faint smile.  “I should be jealous, I really should. To think that she should kiss any one else! That she   should love a stranger more than her father! It’s painful to imagine it. Of course, that’s all  nonsense, of course every father would be reasonable at last. But I believe before I should let   her marry, I should worry myself to death; I should find fault with all her suitors. But I should   end by letting her marry whom she herself loved. The one whom the daughter loves always   seems the worst to the father, you know. That is always so. So many family troubles come   from that.”  “Some are glad to sell their daughters, rather than marrying them honourably.”   Ah, so that was it!   “Such a thing, Liza, happens in those accursed families in which there is neither love nor   God,” I retorted warmly, “and where there is no love, there is no sense either. There are such  76",
    " families, it’s true, but I am not speaking of them. You must have seen wickedness in your   own family, if you talk like that. Truly, you must have been unlucky. H’m! ... that sort of   thing mostly comes about through poverty.”   “And is it any better with the gentry? Even among the poor, honest people live happily.”   “H’m ... yes. Perhaps. Another thing, Liza, man is fond of reckoning up his troubles, but does   not count his joys. If he counted them up as he ought, he would see that every lot has enough   happiness provided for it. And what if all goes well with the family, if the blessing of God is   upon it, if the husband is a good one, loves you, cherishes you, never leaves you! There is   happiness in such a family! Even sometimes there is happiness in the midst of sorrow; and   indeed sorrow is everywhere. If you marry  you will find out for yourself . But think of the first  years of married life with one you love: what happiness, what happiness there sometimes is in   it! And indeed it’s the ordinary thing. In those early days even quarrels with one’s husband   end happily. Some women get up quarrels with their husbands just because they love them.   Indeed, I knew a woman like that: she seemed to say that because she loved him, she would   torment him and make him feel it. You know that you may torment a man on purpose through   love. Women are particularly given to that, thinking to themselves ‘I will love him so, I will  make so much of him afterwards, that it’s no sin to torment him a little now.’ And all in the  house rejoice in the sight of you, and you are happy and gay and peaceful and honourable....   Then there are some women who are jealous. If he went off anywhere—I knew one such   woman, she couldn’t restrain herself, but would jump up at night and run off on the sly to   find out where he was, whether he was with some other woman. That’s a pity. And the   woman knows herself it’s wrong, and her heart fails her and she suffers, but she loves—it’s  all through love. And how sweet it is to make it up after quarrels, to own herself in the wrong   or to forgive him! And they are both so happy all at once—as though they had met anew,   been married over again; as though their love had begun afresh. And no one, no one should   know what passes between husband and wife if they love one another. And whatever quarrels   there may be between them they ought not to call in their own mother to judge between them   and tell tales of one another. They are their own judges. Love is a holy mystery and ought to   be hidden from all other eyes, whatever happens. That makes it holier and better. They   respect one another more, and much is built on respect. And if once there has been love, if   they have been married for love, why should love pass away? Surely one can keep it! It is   rare that one cannot keep it. And if the husband is kind and straightforward, why should not   love last? The first phase of married love will pass, it is true, but then there will come a love   that is better still. Then there will be the union of souls, they will have everything in common,  there will be no secrets between them. And once they have children, the most difficult times   will seem to them happy, so long as there is love and courage. Even toil will be a joy, you   may deny yourself bread for your children and even that will be a joy. They will love you for   it afterwards; so you are laying by for your future. As the children grow up you feel that you   are an example, a support for them; that even after you die your children will always keep   your thoughts and feelings, because they have received them from you, they will take on your   semblance and likeness. So you see this is a great duty. How can it fail to draw the father and   mother nearer? People say it’s a trial to have children. Who says that? It is heavenly  happiness! Are you fond of little children, Liza? I am awfully fond of them. You know—a   little rosy baby boy at your bosom, and what husband’s heart is not touched, seeing his wife   nursing his child! A plump little rosy baby, sprawling and snuggling, chubby little hands and   feet, clean tiny little nails, so tiny that it makes one laugh to look at them; eyes that look as if   they understand everything. And while it sucks it clutches at your bosom with its little hand,   plays. When its father comes up, the child tears itself away from the bosom, flings itself back,   looks at its father, laughs, as though it were fearfully funny and falls to sucking again. Or it  77",
    " will bite its mother’s breast when its little teeth are coming, while it looks sideways at her  with its little eyes as though to say, ‘Look, I am biting!’ Is not all that happiness when they   are the three together, husband, wife and child? One can forgive a great deal for the sake of   such moments. Yes, Liza, one must first learn to live oneself before one blames others!”   “It’s by pictures, pictures like that one must get at you,” I thought to myself, though I did  speak with real feeling, and all at once I flushed crimson. “What if she were suddenly to burst   out laughing, what should I do then?” That idea drove me to fury. Towards the end of my   speech I really was excited, and now my vanity was somehow wounded. The silence   continued. I almost nudged her.   “Why are you——” she began and stopped. But I understood: there was a quiver of   something different in her voice, not abrupt, harsh and unyielding as before, but something   soft and shamefaced, so shamefaced that I suddenly felt ashamed and guilty.   “What?” I asked, with tender curiosity.  “Why, you....”   “What?”  “Why, you ... speak somehow like a book,” she said, and again there was a note of irony in   her voice.  That remark sent a pang to my heart. It was not what I was expecting.   I did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony, that this is usually the last   refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and   intrusively invaded, and that their pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment   and shrink from giving expression to their feelings before you. I ought to have guessed the   truth from the timidity with which she had repeatedly approached her sarcasm, only bringing   herself to utter it at last with an effort. But I did not guess, and an evil feeling took possession  of me.  “Wait a bit!” I thought.  VII   “Oh, hush, Liza! How can you talk about being like a book, when it makes even me, an   outsider, feel sick? Though I don’t look at it as an outsider, for, indeed, it touches me to the   heart.... Is it possible, is it possible that you do not feel sick at being here yourself? Evidently   habit does wonders! God knows what habit can do with any one. Can you seriously think that   you will never grow old, that you will always be good-looking, and that they will keep you   here for ever and ever? I say nothing of the loathsomeness of the life here.... Though let me   tell you this about it—about your present life, I mean; here though you are young now,   attractive, nice, with soul and feeling, yet you know as soon as I came to myself just now I   felt at once sick at being here with you! One can only come here when one is drunk. But if   you were anywhere else, living as good people live, I should perhaps be more than attracted   by you, should fall in love with you, should be glad of a look from you, let alone a word; I   should hang about your door, should go down on my knees to you, should look upon you as   my betrothed and think it an honour to be allowed to. I should not dare to have an impure   thought about you. But here, you see, I know that I have only to whistle and you have to   come with me whether you like it or not. I don’t consult your wishes, but you mine. The   lowest labourer hires himself as a workman but he doesn’t make a slave of himself  altogether; besides, he knows that he will be free again presently. But when are you free?   Only think what you are giving up here? What is it you are making a slave of? It is your soul,  78",
    " together with your body; you are selling your soul which you have no right to dispose of!   You give your love to be outraged by every drunkard! Love! But that’s everything, you   know, it’s a priceless diamond, it’s a maiden’s treasure, love—why, a man would be ready to  give his soul, to face death to gain that love. But how much is your love worth now? You are   sold, all of you, body and soul, and there is no need to strive for love when you can have   everything without love. And you know there is no greater insult to a girl than that, do you   understand? To be sure, I have heard that they comfort you, poor fools, they let you have   lovers of your own here. But you know that’s simply a farce, that’s simply a sham, it’s just  laughing at you, and you are taken in by it! Why, do you suppose he really loves you, that   lover of yours? I don’t believe it. How can he love you when he knows you may be called   away from him any minute? He would be a low fellow if he did! Will he have a grain of   respect for you? What have you in common with him? He laughs at you and robs you—that   is all his love amounts to! You are lucky if he does not beat you. Very likely he does beat   you, too. Ask him, if you have got one, whether he will marry you. He will laugh in your   face, if he doesn’t spit in it or give you a blow—though maybe he is not worth a bad  halfpenny himself. And for what have you ruined your life, if you come to think of it? For the   coffee they give you to drink and the plentiful meals? But with what object are they feeding   you up? An honest girl couldn’t swallow the food, for she would know what she was being   fed for. You are in debt here, and, of course, you will always be in debt, and you will go on in   debt to the end, till the visitors here begin to scorn you. And that will soon happen, don’t rely  upon your youth—all that flies by express train here, you know. You will be kicked out. And   not simply kicked out; long before that she’ll begin nagging at you, scolding you, abusing   you, as though you had not sacrificed your health for her, had not thrown away your youth   and your soul for her benefit, but as though you had ruined her, beggared her, robbed her.   And don’t expect any one to take your part: the others, your companions, will attack you, too,   to win her favour, for all are in slavery here, and have lost all conscience and pity here long   ago. They have become utterly vile, and nothing on earth is viler, more loathsome, and more   insulting than their abuse. And you are laying down everything here, unconditionally, youth   and health and beauty and hope, and at twenty-two you will look like a woman of five-and- thirty, and you will be lucky if you are not diseased, pray to God for that! No doubt you are   thinking now that you have a gay time and no work to do! Yet there is no work harder or   more dreadful in the world or ever has been. One would think that the heart alone would be   worn out with tears. And you won’t dare to say a word, not half a word when they drive you   away from here; you will go away as though you were to blame. You will change to another   house, then to a third, then somewhere else, till you come down at last to the Haymarket.   There you will be beaten at every turn; that is good manners there, the visitors don’t know   how to be friendly without beating you. You don’t believe that it is so hateful there? Go and  look for yourself some time, you can see with your own eyes. Once, one New Year’s Day, I   saw a woman at a door. They had turned her out as a joke, to give her a taste of the frost   because she had been crying so much, and they shut the door behind her. At nine o’clock in   the morning she was already quite drunk, dishevelled, half-naked, covered with bruises, her   face was powdered, but she had a black eye, blood was trickling from her nose and her teeth;   some cabman had just given her a drubbing. She was sitting on the stone steps, a salt fish of   some sort was in her hand; she was crying, wailing something about her luck and beating   with the fish on the steps, and cabmen and drunken soldiers were crowding in the doorway   taunting her. You don’t believe that you will ever be like that? I should be sorry to believe it,   too, but how do you know; maybe ten years, eight years ago that very woman with the salt   fish came here fresh as a cherub, innocent, pure, knowing no evil, blushing at every word.   Perhaps she was like you, proud, ready to take offence, not like the others; perhaps she   looked like a queen, and knew what happiness was in store for the man who should love her  79",
    " and whom she should love. Do you see how it ended? And what if at that very minute when   she was beating on the filthy steps with that fish, drunken and dishevelled—what if at that   very minute she recalled the pure early days in her father’s house, when she used to go to   school and the neighbour’s son watched for her on the way, declaring that he would love her   as long as he lived, that he would devote his life to her, and when they vowed to love one   another for ever and be married as soon as they were grown up! No, Liza, it would be happy   for you if you were to die soon of consumption in some corner, in some cellar like that   woman just now. In the hospital, do you say? You will be lucky if they take you, but what if   you are still of use to the madam here? Consumption is a queer disease, it is not like fever.   The patient goes on hoping till the last minute and says he is all right. He deludes himself.   And that just suits your madam. Don’t doubt it, that’s how it is; you have sold your soul, and   what is more you owe money, so you daren’t say a word. But when you are dying, all will   abandon you, all will turn away from you, for then there will be nothing to get from you.   What’s more, they will reproach you for cumbering the place, for being so long over dying.  However you beg you won’t get a drink of water without abuse: ‘Whenever are you going   off, you nasty hussy, you won’t let us sleep with your moaning, you make the gentlemen   sick.’ That’s true, I have heard such things said myself. They will thrust you dying into the  filthiest corner in the cellar—in the damp and darkness; what will your thoughts be, lying  there alone? When you die, strange hands will lay you out, with grumbling and impatience;  no one will bless you, no one will sigh for you, they only want to get rid of you as soon as   may be; they will buy a coffin, take you to the grave as they did that poor woman to-day, and   celebrate your memory at the tavern. In the grave sleet, filth, wet snow—no need to put  themselves out for you—’Let her down, Vanuha; it’s just like her luck—even here, she is  head-foremost, the hussy. Shorten the cord, you rascal.’ ‘It’s all right as it is.’ ‘All right, is it?  Why, she’s on her side! She was a fellow-creature, after all! But, never mind, throw the earth   on her.’ And they won’t care to waste much time quarrelling over you. They will scatter the   wet blue clay as quick as they can and go off to the tavern ... and there your memory on earth   will end; other women have children to go to their graves, fathers, husbands. While for you   neither tear, nor sigh, nor remembrance; no one in the whole world will ever come to you,   your name will vanish from the face of the earth—as though you had never existed, never   been born at all! Nothing but filth and mud, however you knock at your coffin lid at night,   when the dead arise, however you cry: ‘Let me out, kind people, to live in the light of day!   My life was no life at all; my life has been thrown away like a dish-clout; it was drunk away  in the tavern at the Haymarket; let me out, kind people, to live in the world again.’”   And I worked myself up to such a pitch that I began to have a lump in my throat myself, and   ... and all at once I stopped, sat up in dismay, and bending over apprehensively, began to   listen with a beating heart. I had reason to be troubled.   I had felt for some time that I was turning her soul upside down and rending her heart, and—  and the more I was convinced of it, the more eagerly I desired to gain my object as quickly   and as effectually as possible. It was the exercise of my skill that carried me away; yet it was  not merely sport....   I knew I was speaking stiffly, artificially, even bookishly, in fact, I could not speak except   “like a book.” But that did not trouble me: I knew, I felt that I should be understood and that   this very bookishness might be an assistance. But now, having attained my effect, I was   suddenly panic-stricken. Never before had I witnessed such despair! She was lying on her   face, thrusting her face into the pillow and clutching it in both hands. Her heart was being   torn. Her youthful body was shuddering all over as though in convulsions. Suppressed sobs   rent her bosom and suddenly burst out in weeping and wailing, then she pressed closer into   the pillow: she did not want any one here, not a living soul, to know of her anguish and her  80",
    " tears. She bit the pillow, bit her hand till it bled (I saw that afterwards), or, thrusting her   fingers into her dishevelled hair seemed rigid with the effort of restraint, holding her breath   and clenching her teeth. I began saying something, begging her to calm herself, but felt that I  did not dare; and all at once, in a sort of cold shiver, almost in terror, began fumbling in the   dark, trying hurriedly to get dressed to go. It was dark: though I tried my best I could not   finish dressing quickly. Suddenly I felt a box of matches and a candlestick with a whole   candle in it. As soon as the room was lighted up, Liza sprang up, sat up in bed, and with a   contorted face, with a half insane smile, looked at me almost senselessly. I sat down beside   her and took her hands; she came to herself, made an impulsive movement towards me,   would have caught hold of me, but did not dare, and slowly bowed her head before me.   “Liza, my dear, I was wrong ... forgive me, my dear,” I began, but she squeezed my hand in   her fingers so tightly that I felt I was saying the wrong thing and stopped.   “This is my address, Liza, come to me.”   “I will come,” she answered resolutely, her head still bowed.  “But now I am going, good-bye ... till we meet again.”  I got up; she, too, stood up and suddenly flushed all over, gave a shudder, snatched up a   shawl that was lying on a chair and muffled herself in it to her chin. As she did this she gave   another sickly smile, blushed and looked at me strangely. I felt wretched; I was in haste to get  away—to disappear.  “Wait a minute,” she said suddenly, in the passage just at the doorway, stopping me with her  hand on my overcoat. She put down the candle in hot haste and ran off; evidently she had   thought of something or wanted to show me something. As she ran away she flushed, her   eyes shone, and there was a smile on her lips—what was the meaning of it? Against my will I  waited: she came back a minute later with an expression that seemed to ask forgiveness for   something. In fact, it was not the same face, not the same look as the evening before: sullen,   mistrustful and obstinate. Her eyes now were imploring, soft, and at the same time trustful,   caressing, timid. The expression with which children look at people they are very fond of, of   whom they are asking a favour. Her eyes were a light hazel, they were lovely eyes, full of   life, and capable of expressing love as well as sullen hatred.   Making no explanation, as though I, as a sort of higher being, must understand everything   without explanations, she held out a piece of paper to me. Her whole face was positively   beaming at that instant with naïve, almost childish, triumph. I unfolded it. It was a letter to  her from a medical student or some one of that sort—a very high-flown and flowery, but   extremely respectful, love-letter. I don’t recall the words now, but I remember well that   through the high-flown phrases there was apparent a genuine feeling, which cannot be   feigned. When I had finished reading it I met her glowing, questioning, and childishly   impatient eyes fixed upon me. She fastened her eyes upon my face and waited impatiently for   what I should say. In a few words, hurriedly, but with a sort of joy and pride, she explained to   me that she had been to a dance somewhere in a private house, a family of “very nice  people,  who knew nothing , absolutely nothing, for she had only come here so lately and it had   all happened ... and she hadn’t made up her mind to stay and was certainly going away as   soon as she had paid her debt ... and at that party there had been the student who had danced   with her all the evening. He had talked to her, and it turned out that he had known her in old   days at Riga when he was a child, they had played together, but a very long time ago—and he   knew her parents, but  about this  he knew nothing, nothing whatever, and had no suspicion!  And the day after the dance (three days ago) he had sent her that letter through the friend with   whom she had gone to the party ... and ... well, that was all.”  81",
    " She dropped her shining eyes with a sort of bashfulness as she finished.   The poor girl was keeping that student’s letter as a precious treasure, and had run to fetch it,   her only treasure, because she did not want me to go away without knowing that she, too, was   honestly and genuinely loved; that she, too, was addressed respectfully. No doubt that letter   was destined to lie in her box and lead to nothing. But none the less, I am certain that she   would keep it all her life as a precious treasure, as her pride and justification, and now at such   a minute she had thought of that letter and brought it with naïve pride to raise herself in my   eyes that I might see, that I, too, might think well of her. I said nothing, pressed her hand and   went out. I so longed to get away.... I walked all the way home, in spite of the fact that the   melting snow was still falling in heavy flakes. I was exhausted, shattered, in bewilderment.  But behind the bewilderment the truth was already gleaming. The loathsome truth.   VIII   It was some time, however, before I consented to recognize that truth. Waking up in the   morning after some hours of heavy, leaden sleep, and immediately realizing all that had   happened on the previous day, I was positively amazed at my last night’s  sentimentality  with  Liza, at all those “outcries of horror and pity.” “To think of having such an attack of   womanish hysteria, pah!” I concluded. And what did I thrust my address upon her for? What   if she comes? Let her come, though; it doesn’t matter.... But  obviously , that was not now the  chief and the most important matter: I had to make haste and at all costs save my reputation   in the eyes of Zverkov and Simonov as quickly as possible; that was the chief business. And I   was so taken up that morning that I actually forgot all about Liza.   First of all I had at once to repay what I had borrowed the day before from Simonov. I   resolved on a desperate measure: to borrow fifteen roubles straight off from Anton Antonitch.   As luck would have it he was in the best of humours that morning, and gave it to me at once,   on the first asking. I was so delighted at this that, as I signed the I O U with a swaggering air,   I told him casually that the night before “I had been keeping it up with some friends at the   Hôtel de Paris; we were giving a farewell party to a comrade, in fact, I might say a friend of   my childhood, and you know—a desperate rake, fearfully spoilt—of course, he belongs to a  good family, and has considerable means, a brilliant career; he is witty, charming, a regular   Lovelace, you understand; we drank an extra ‘half-dozen’ and....”  And it went off all right; all this was uttered very easily, unconstrainedly and complacently.   On reaching home I promptly wrote to Simonov.   To this hour I am lost in admiration when I recall the truly gentlemanly, good-humoured,   candid tone of my letter. With tact and good-breeding, and, above all, entirely without   superfluous words, I blamed myself for all that had happened. I defended myself, “if I really  may be allowed to defend myself,” by alleging that being utterly unaccustomed to wine, I had   been intoxicated with the first glass, which I said, I had drunk before they arrived, while I   was waiting for them at the Hôtel de Paris between five and six o’clock. I begged Simonov’s  pardon especially; I asked him to convey my explanations to all the others, especially to   Zverkov, whom “I seemed to remember as though in a dream” I had insulted. I added that I   would have called upon all of them myself, but my head ached, and besides I had not the face   to. I was particularly pleased with a certain lightness, almost carelessness (strictly within the   bounds of politeness, however), which was apparent in my style, and better than any possible   arguments, gave them at once to understand that I took rather an independent view of “all that  unpleasantness last night;” that I was by no means so utterly crushed as you, my friends,   probably imagine; but on the contrary, looked upon it as a gentleman serenely respecting   himself should look upon it. “On a young hero’s past no censure is cast!”  82",
    " “There is actually an aristocratic playfulness about it!” I thought admiringly, as I read over  the letter. And it’s all because I am an intellectual and cultivated man! Another man in my  place would not have known how to extricate himself, but here I have got out of it and am as   jolly as ever again, and all because I am “a cultivated and educated man of our day.” And,   indeed, perhaps, everything was due to the wine yesterday. H’m! ... no, it was not the wine. I   did not drink anything at all between five and six when I was waiting for them. I had lied to   Simonov; I had lied shamelessly; and indeed I wasn’t ashamed now.... Hang it all though, the   great thing was that I was rid of it.  I put six roubles in the letter, sealed it up, and asked Apollon to take it to Simonov. When he   learned that there was money in the letter, Apollon became more respectful and agreed to   take it. Towards evening I went out for a walk. My head was still aching and giddy after   yesterday. But as evening came on and the twilight grew denser, my impressions and,   following them, my thoughts, grew more and more different and confused. Something was   not dead within me, in the depths of my heart and conscience it would not die, and it showed   itself in acute depression. For the most part I jostled my way through the most crowded   business streets, along Myeshtchansky Street, along Sadovy Street and in Yusupov Garden. I   always liked particularly sauntering along these streets in the dusk, just when there were   crowds of working people of all sorts going home from their daily work, with faces looking   cross with anxiety. What I liked was just that cheap bustle, that bare prose. On this occasion   the jostling of the streets irritated me more than ever. I could not make out what was wrong  with me, I could not find the clue, something seemed rising up continually in my soul,   painfully, and refusing to be appeased. I returned home completely upset, it was just as   though some crime were lying on my conscience.   The thought that Liza was coming worried me continually. It seemed queer to me that of all   my recollections of yesterday this tormented me, as it were, especially, as it were, quite   separately. Everything else I had quite succeeded in forgetting by the evening; I dismissed it  all and was still perfectly satisfied with my letter to Simonov. But on this point I was not   satisfied at all. It was as though I were worried only by Liza. “What if she comes,” I thought  incessantly, “well, it doesn’t matter, let her come! H’m! it’s horrid that she should see, for  instance, how I live. Yesterday I seemed such a hero to her, while now, h’m! It’s horrid,  though, that I have let myself go so, the room looks like a beggar’s. And I brought myself to   go out to dinner in such a suit! And my American leather sofa with the stuffing sticking out.   And my dressing-gown, which will not cover me, such tatters, and she will see all this and   she will see Apollon. That beast is certain to insult her. He will fasten upon her in order to be   rude to me. And I, of course, shall be panic-stricken as usual, I shall begin bowing and   scraping before her and pulling my dressing-gown round me, I shall begin smiling, telling   lies. Oh, the beastliness! And it isn’t the beastliness of it that matters most! There is  something more important, more loathsome, viler! Yes, viler! And to put on that dishonest   lying mask again!”...   When I reached that thought I fired up all at once.   “Why dishonest? How dishonest? I was speaking sincerely last night. I remember there was   real feeling in me, too. What I wanted was to excite an honourable feeling in her.... Her   crying was a good thing, it will have a good effect.”   Yet I could not feel at ease. All that evening, even when I had come back home, even after   nine o’clock, when I calculated that Liza could not possibly come, she still haunted me, and   what was worse, she came back to my mind always in the same position. One moment out of   all that had happened last night stood vividly before my imagination; the moment when I  struck a match and saw her pale, distorted face, with its look of torture. And what a pitiful,  83",
    " what an unnatural, what a distorted smile she had at that moment! But I did not know then,   that fifteen years later I should still in my imagination see Liza, always with the pitiful,   distorted, inappropriate smile which was on her face at that minute.   Next day I was ready again to look upon it all as nonsense, due to over-excited nerves, and,   above all, as  exaggerated . I was always conscious of that weak point of mine, and sometimes  very much afraid of it. “I exaggerate everything, that is where I go wrong,” I repeated to   myself every hour. But, however, “Liza will very likely come all the same,” was the refrain  with which all my reflections ended. I was so uneasy that I sometimes flew into a fury:   “She’ll come, she is certain to come!” I cried, running about the room, “if not to-day, she will  come to-morrow; she’ll find me out! The damnable romanticism of these pure hearts! Oh, the  vileness—oh, the silliness—oh, the stupidity of these ‘wretched sentimental souls!’ Why,  how fail to understand? How could one fail to understand?...”   But at this point I stopped short, and in great confusion, indeed.   And how few, how few words, I thought, in passing, were needed; how little of the idyllic   (and affectedly, bookishly, artificially idyllic too) had sufficed to turn a whole human life at   once according to my will. That’s virginity, to be sure! Freshness of soil!   At times a thought occurred to me, to go to her, “to tell her all,” and beg her not to come to  me. But this thought stirred such wrath in me that I believed I should have crushed that   “damned” Liza if she had chanced to be near me at the time. I should have insulted her, have  spat at her, have turned her out, have struck her!   One day passed, however, another and another; she did not come and I began to grow calmer.   I felt particularly bold and cheerful after nine o’clock, I even sometimes began dreaming, and   rather sweetly: I, for instance, became the salvation of Liza, simply through her coming to me   and my talking to her.... I develop her, educate her. Finally, I notice that she loves me, loves   me passionately. I pretend not to understand (I don’t know, however, why I pretend, just for   effect, perhaps). At last all confusion, transfigured, trembling and sobbing, she flings herself   at my feet and says that I am her saviour, and that she loves me better than anything in the   world. I am amazed, but.... “Liza,” I say, “can you imagine that I have not noticed your love,  I saw it all, I divined it, but I did not dare to approach you first, because I had an influence   over you and was afraid that you would force yourself, from gratitude, to respond to my love,   would try to rouse in your heart a feeling which was perhaps absent, and I did not wish that ...   because it would be tyranny ... it would be indelicate (in short, I launch off at that point into   European, inexplicably lofty subtleties à la George Sand), but now, now you are mine, you   are my creation, you are pure, you are good, you are my noble wife.   ‘Into my house come bold and free,   Its rightful mistress there to be.’”  Then we begin living together, go abroad and so on, and so on. In fact, in the end it seemed   vulgar to me myself, and I began putting out my tongue at myself.   Besides, they won’t let her out, “the hussy!” I thought. They don’t let them go out very  readily, especially in the evening (for some reason I fancied she would come in the evening,   and at seven o’clock precisely). Though she did say she was not altogether a slave there yet,  and had certain rights; so, h’m! Damn it all, she will come, she is sure to come!  It was a good thing, in fact, that Apollon distracted my attention at that time by his rudeness.   He drove me beyond all patience! He was the bane of my life, the curse laid upon me by   Providence. We had been squabbling continually for years, and I hated him. My God, how I   hated him! I believe I had never hated any one in my life as I hated him, especially at some  84",
    " moments. He was an elderly, dignified man, who worked part of his time as a tailor. But for   some unknown reason he despised me beyond all measure, and looked down upon me   insufferably. Though, indeed, he looked down upon every one. Simply to glance at that   flaxen, smoothly brushed head, at the tuft of hair he combed up on his forehead and oiled   with sunflower oil, at that dignified mouth, compressed into the shape of the letter V, made   one feel one was confronting a man who never doubted of himself. He was a pedant, to the   most extreme point, the greatest pedant I had met on earth, and with that had a vanity only   befitting Alexander of Macedon. He was in love with every button on his coat, every nail on   his fingers—absolutely in love with them, and he looked it! In his behaviour to me he was a   perfect tyrant, he spoke very little to me, and if he chanced to glance at me he gave me a firm,   majestically self-confident and invariably ironical look that drove me sometimes to fury. He  did his work with the air of doing me the greatest favour. Though he did scarcely anything for   me, and did not, indeed, consider himself bound to do anything. There could be no doubt that   he looked upon me as the greatest fool on earth, and that “he did not get rid of me” was   simply that he could get wages from me every month. He consented to do nothing for me for   seven roubles a month. Many sins should be forgiven me for what I suffered from him. My   hatred reached such a point that sometimes his very step almost threw me into convulsions.   What I loathed particularly was his lisp. His tongue must have been a little too long or   something of that sort, for he continually lisped, and seemed to be very proud of it, imagining   that it greatly added to his dignity. He spoke in a slow, measured tone, with his hands behind   his back and his eyes fixed on the ground. He maddened me particularly when he read aloud   the psalms to himself behind his partition. Many a battle I waged over that reading! But he   was awfully fond of reading aloud in the evenings, in a slow, even, sing-song voice, as   though over the dead. It is interesting that that is how he has ended: he hires himself out to   read the psalms over the dead, and at the same time he kills rats and makes blacking. But at   that time I could not get rid of him, it was as though he were chemically combined with my   existence. Besides, nothing would have induced him to consent to leave me. I could not live   in furnished lodgings: my lodging was my private solitude, my shell, my cave, in which I  concealed myself from all mankind, and Apollon seemed to me, for some reason, an integral   part of that flat, and for seven years I could not turn him away.   To be two or three days behind with his wages, for instance, was impossible. He would have   made such a fuss, I should not have known where to hide my head. But I was so exasperated   with every one during those days, that I made up my mind for some reason and with some   object to  punish  Apollon and not to pay him for a fortnight the wages that were owing him. I  had for a long time—for the last two years—been intending to do this, simply in order to  teach him not to give himself airs with me, and to show him that if I liked I could withhold   his wages. I purposed to say nothing to him about it, and was purposely silent indeed, in order   to score off his pride and force him to be the first to speak of his wages. Then I would take   the seven roubles out of a drawer, show him I have the money put aside on purpose, but that I   won’t, I won’t, I simply won’t pay him his wages, I won’t just because that is “what I wish,”  because “I am master, and it is for me to decide,” because he has been disrespectful, because  he has been rude; but if he were to ask respectfully I might be softened and give it to him,   otherwise he might wait another fortnight, another three weeks, a whole month....   But angry as I was, yet he got the better of me. I could not hold out for four days. He began   as he always did begin in such cases, for there had been such cases already, there had been   attempts (and it may be observed I knew all this beforehand, I knew his nasty tactics by   heart). He would begin by fixing upon me an exceedingly severe stare, keeping it up for   several minutes at a time, particularly on meeting me or seeing me out of the house. If I held   out and pretended not to notice these stares, he would, still in silence, proceed to further  85",
    " tortures. All at once,  à propos  of nothing, he would walk softly and smoothly into my room,  when I was pacing up and down or reading, stand at the door, one hand behind his back and   one foot behind the other, and fix upon me a stare more than severe, utterly contemptuous. If   I suddenly asked him what he wanted, he would make me no answer, but continue staring at   me persistently for some seconds, then, with a peculiar compression of his lips and a most   significant air, deliberately turn round and deliberately go back to his room. Two hours later  he would come out again and again present himself before me in the same way. It had   happened that in my fury I did not even ask him what he wanted, but simply raised my head   sharply and imperiously and began staring back at him. So we stared at one another for two   minutes; at last he turned with deliberation and dignity and went back again for two hours.   If I were still not brought to reason by all this, but persisted in my revolt, he would suddenly   begin sighing while he looked at me, long, deep sighs as though measuring by them the   depths of my moral degradation, and, of course, it ended at last by his triumphing completely:   I raged and shouted, but still was forced to do what he wanted.   This time the usual staring manœuvres had scarcely begun when I lost my temper and flew at   him in a fury. I was irritated beyond endurance apart from him.   “Stay,” I cried, in a frenzy, as he was slowly and silently turning, with one hand behind his  back, to go to his room, “stay! Come back, come back, I tell you!” and I must have bawled so   unnaturally, that he turned round and even looked at me with some wonder. However, he   persisted in saying nothing, and that infuriated me.   “How dare you come and look at me like that without being sent for? Answer!”   After looking at me calmly for half a minute, he began turning round again.   “Stay!” I roared, running up to him, “don’t stir! There. Answer, now: what did you come in  to look at?”   “If you have any order to give me it’s my duty to carry it out,” he answered, after another   silent pause, with a slow, measured lisp, raising his eyebrows and calmly twisting his head   from one side to another, all this with exasperating composure.   “That’s not what I am asking you about, you torturer!” I shouted, turning crimson with anger.  “I’ll tell you why you came here myself: you see, I don’t give you your wages, you are so   proud you don’t want to bow down and ask for it, and so you come to punish me with your   stupid stares, to worry me and you have no sus...pic...ion how stupid it is—stupid, stupid,   stupid, stupid!”...   He would have turned round again without a word, but I seized him.   “Listen,” I shouted to him. “Here’s the money, do you see, here it is” (I took it out of the  table drawer); “here’s the seven roubles complete, but you are not going to have it, you ... are  ... not ... going ... to ... have it until you come respectfully with bowed head to beg my pardon.   Do you hear?”   “That cannot be,” he answered, with the most unnatural self-confidence.  “It shall be so,” I said, “I give you my word of honour, it shall be!”   “And there’s nothing for me to beg your pardon for,” he went on, as though he had not   noticed my exclamations at all. “Why, besides, you called me a ‘torturer,’ for which I can  summon you at the police-station at any time for insulting behaviour.”   “Go, summon me,” I roared, “go at once, this very minute, this very second! You are a  torturer all the same! a torturer!”  86",
    " But he merely looked at me, then turned, and regardless of my loud calls to him, he walked to   his room with an even step and without looking round.   “If it had not been for Liza nothing of this would have happened,” I decided inwardly. Then,   after waiting a minute, I went myself behind his screen with a dignified and solemn air,   though my heart was beating slowly and violently.   “Apollon,” I said quietly and emphatically, though I was breathless, “go at once without a   minute’s delay and fetch the police-officer.”  He had meanwhile settled himself at his table, put on his spectacles and taken up some   sewing. But, hearing my order, he burst into a guffaw.   “At once, go this minute! Go on, or else you can’t imagine what will happen.”  “You are certainly out of your mind,” he observed, without even raising his head, lisping as   deliberately as ever and threading his needle. “Whoever heard of a man sending for the police   against himself? And as for being frightened—you are upsetting yourself about nothing, for   nothing will come of it.”  “Go!” I shrieked, clutching him by the shoulder. I felt I should strike him in a minute.  But I did not notice the door from the passage softly and slowly open at that instant and a   figure come in, stop short, and begin staring at us in perplexity. I glanced, nearly swooned   with shame, and rushed back to my room. There, clutching at my hair with both hands, I   leaned my head against the wall and stood motionless in that position.   Two minutes later I heard Apollon’s deliberate footsteps. “There is some woman asking for  you,” he said, looking at me with peculiar severity. Then he stood aside and let in Liza. He   would not go away, but stared at us sarcastically.   “Go away, go away,” I commanded in desperation. At that moment my clock began whirring   and wheezing and struck seven.   IX  “Into my house come bold and free,   Its rightful mistress there to be.”  I stood before her crushed, crestfallen, revoltingly confused, and I believe I smiled as I did   my utmost to wrap myself in the skirts of my ragged wadded dressing-gown—exactly as I   had imagined the scene not long before in a fit of depression. After standing over us for a   couple of minutes Apollon went away, but that did not make me more at ease. What made it   worse was that she, too, was overwhelmed with confusion, more so, in fact, than I should   have expected. At the sight of me, of course.   “Sit down,” I said mechanically, moving a chair up to the table, and I sat down on the sofa.   She obediently sat down at once and gazed at me open-eyed, evidently expecting something   from me at once. This naïveté of expectation drove me to fury, but I restrained myself.  She ought to have tried not to notice, as though everything had been as usual, while instead of   that, she ... and I dimly felt that I should make her pay dearly for  all this .  “You have found me in a strange position, Liza,” I began, stammering and knowing that this   was the wrong way to begin. “No, no, don’t imagine anything,” I cried, seeing that she had   suddenly flushed. “I am not ashamed of my poverty.... On the contrary I look with pride on   my poverty. I am poor but honourable.... One can be poor and honourable,” I muttered.   “However ... would you like tea?”...  87",
    " “No,” she was beginning.  “Wait a minute.”  I leapt up and ran to Apollon. I had to get out of the room somehow.   “Apollon,” I whispered in feverish haste, flinging down before him the seven roubles which   had remained all the time in my clenched fist, “here are your wages, you see I give them to   you; but for that you must come to my rescue: bring me tea and a dozen rusks from the   restaurant. If you won’t go, you’ll make me a miserable man! You don’t know what this  woman is.... This is—everything! You may be imagining something.... But you don’t know   what that woman is!”...  Apollon, who had already sat down to his work and put on his spectacles again, at first   glanced askance at the money without speaking or putting down his needle; then, without   paying the slightest attention to me or making any answer he went on busying himself with  his needle, which he had not yet threaded. I waited before him for three minutes with my   arms crossed  à la Napoléon . My temples were moist with sweat. I was pale, I felt it. But,  thank God, he must have been moved to pity, looking at me. Having threaded his needle he   deliberately got up from his seat, deliberately moved back his chair, deliberately took off his   spectacles, deliberately counted the money, and finally asking me over his shoulder: “Shall I  get a whole portion?” deliberately walked out of the room. As I was going back to Liza, the   thought occurred to me on the way: shouldn’t I run away just as I was in my dressing-gown,   no matter where, and then let happen what would.   I sat down again. She looked at me uneasily. For some minutes we were silent.   “I will kill him,” I shouted suddenly, striking the table with my fist so that the ink spurted out  of the inkstand.   “What are you saying!” she cried, starting.   “I will kill him! kill him!” I shrieked, suddenly striking the table in absolute frenzy, and at the  same time fully understanding how stupid it was to be in such a frenzy. “You don’t know,   Liza, what that torturer is to me. He is my torturer.... He has gone now to fetch some rusks;   he....”   And suddenly I burst into tears. It was an hysterical attack. How ashamed I felt in the midst   of my sobs; but still I could not restrain them.   She was frightened.  “What is the matter? What is wrong?” she cried, fussing about me.  “Water, give me water, over there!” I muttered in a faint voice, though I was inwardly  conscious that I could have got on very well without water and without muttering in a faint   voice. But I was, what is called,  putting it on , to save appearances, though the attack was a  genuine one.   She gave me water, looking at me in bewilderment. At that moment Apollon brought in the   tea. It suddenly seemed to me that this commonplace, prosaic tea was horribly undignified   and paltry after all that had happened, and I blushed crimson. Liza looked at Apollon with   positive alarm. He went out without a glance at either of us.   “Liza, do you despise me?” I asked, looking at her fixedly, trembling with impatience to   know what she was thinking.   She was confused, and did not know what to answer.  88",
    " “Drink your tea,” I said to her angrily. I was angry with myself, but, of course, it was she who   would have to pay for it. A horrible spite against her suddenly surged up in my heart; I   believe I could have killed her. To revenge myself on her I swore inwardly not to say a word   to her all the time. “She is the cause of it all,” I thought.  Our silence lasted for five minutes. The tea stood on the table; we did not touch it. I had got   to the point of purposely refraining from beginning in order to embarrass her further; it was   awkward for her to begin alone. Several times she glanced at me with mournful perplexity. I  was obstinately silent. I was, of course, myself the chief sufferer, because I was fully   conscious of the disgusting meanness of my spiteful stupidity, and yet at the same time I   could not restrain myself.   “I want to ... get away ... from there altogether,” she began, to break the silence in some way,   but, poor girl, that was just what she ought not to have spoken about at such a stupid moment   to a man so stupid as I was. My heart positively ached with pity for her tactless and   unnecessary straightforwardness. But something hideous at once stifled all compassion in me;   it even provoked me to greater venom. I did not care what happened. Another five minutes   passed.  “Perhaps I am in your way,” she began timidly, hardly audibly, and was getting up.   But as soon as I saw this first impulse of wounded dignity I positively trembled with spite,   and at once burst out.   “Why have you come to me, tell me that, please?” I began, gasping for breath and regardless  of logical connection in my words. I longed to have it all out at once, at one burst; I did not   even trouble how to begin. “Why have you come? Answer, answer,” I cried, hardly knowing   what I was doing. “I’ll tell you, my good girl, why you have come. You’ve come because I  talked sentimental stuff to you then. So now you are soft as butter and longing for fine   sentiments again. So you may as well know that I was laughing at you then. And I am   laughing at you now. Why are you shuddering? Yes, I was laughing at you! I had been   insulted just before, at dinner, by the fellows who came that evening before me. I came to   you, meaning to thrash one of them, an officer; but I didn’t succeed, I didn’t find him; I had   to avenge the insult on some one to get back my own again; you turned up, I vented my   spleen on you and laughed at you. I had been humiliated, so I wanted to humiliate; I had been   treated like a rag, so I wanted to show my power.... That’s what it was, and you imagined I   had come there on purpose to save you. Yes? You imagined that? You imagined that?”   I knew that she would perhaps be muddled and not take it all in exactly, but I knew, too, that   she would grasp the gist of it, very well indeed. And so, indeed, she did. She turned white as   a handkerchief, tried to say something, and her lips worked painfully; but she sank on a chair   as though she had been felled by an axe. And all the time afterwards she listened to me with   her lips parted and her eyes wide open, shuddering with awful terror. The cynicism, the   cynicism of my words overwhelmed her....   “Save you!” I went on, jumping up from my chair and running up and down the room before   her. “Save you from what? But perhaps I am worse than you myself. Why didn’t you throw it   in my teeth when I was giving you that sermon: ‘But what did you come here yourself for?   was it to read us a sermon?’ Power, power was what I wanted then, sport was what I wanted,   I wanted to wring out your tears, your humiliation, your hysteria—that was what I wanted   then! Of course, I couldn’t keep it up then, because I am a wretched creature, I was  frightened, and, the devil knows why, gave you my address in my folly. Afterwards, before I   got home, I was cursing and swearing at you because of that address, I hated you already   because of the lies I had told you. Because I only like playing with words, only dreaming,  89",
    " but, do you know, what I really want is that you should all go to hell. That is what I want. I   want peace; yes, I’d sell the whole world for a farthing, straight off, so long as I was left in  peace. Is the world to go to pot, or am I to go without my tea? I say that the world may go to   pot for me so long as I always get my tea. Did you know that, or not? Well, anyway, I know   that I am a blackguard, a scoundrel, an egoist, a sluggard. Here I have been shuddering for   the last three days at the thought of your coming. And do you know what has worried me   particularly for these three days? That I posed as such a hero to you, and now you would see   me in a wretched torn dressing-gown, beggarly, loathsome. I told you just now that I was not  ashamed of my poverty; so you may as well know that I am ashamed of it; I am more   ashamed of it than of anything, more afraid of it than of being found out if I were a thief,   because I am as vain as though I had been skinned and the very air blowing on me hurt.   Surely by now you must realize that I shall never forgive you for having found me in this   wretched dressing-gown, just as I was flying at Apollon like a spiteful cur. The saviour, the  former hero, was flying like a mangy, unkempt sheep-dog at his lackey, and the lackey was   jeering at him! And I shall never forgive you for the tears I could not help shedding before   you just now, like some silly woman put to shame! And for what I am confessing to you now,   I shall never forgive  you  either! Yes—you must answer for it all because you turned up like  this, because I am a blackguard, because I am the nastiest, stupidest, absurdest and most   envious of all the worms on earth, who are not a bit better than I am, but, the devil knows   why, are never put to confusion; while I shall always be insulted by every louse, that is my   doom! And what is it to me that you don’t understand a word of this! And what do I care,   what do I care about you, and whether you go to ruin there or not? Do you understand? How I   shall hate you now after saying this, for having been here and listening. Why, it’s not once in   a lifetime a man speaks out like this, and then it is in hysterics!... What more do you want?   Why do you still stand confronting me, after all this? Why are you worrying me? Why don’t  you go?”   But at this point a strange thing happened. I was so accustomed to think and imagine   everything from books, and to picture everything in the world to myself just as I had made it   up in my dreams beforehand, that I could not all at once take in this strange circumstance.   What happened was this: Liza, insulted and crushed by me, understood a great deal more than   I imagined. She understood from all this what a woman understands first of all, if she feels   genuine love, that is, that I was myself unhappy.   The frightened and wounded expression on her face was followed first by a look of sorrowful   perplexity. When I began calling myself a scoundrel and a blackguard and my tears flowed   (the tirade was accompanied throughout by tears) her whole face worked convulsively. She   was on the point of getting up and stopping me; when I finished she took no notice of my   shouting: “Why are you here, why don’t you go away?” but realized only that it must have   been very bitter to me to say all this. Besides, she was so crushed, poor girl; she considered   herself infinitely beneath me; how could she feel anger or resentment? She suddenly leapt up   from her chair with an irresistible impulse and held out her hands, yearning towards me,   though still timid and not daring to stir.... At this point there was a revulsion in my heart, too.   Then she suddenly rushed to me, threw her arms round me and burst into tears. I, too, could   not restrain myself, and sobbed as I never had before.   “They won’t let me.... I can’t be good!” I managed to articulate; then I went to the sofa, fell  on it face downwards, and sobbed on it for a quarter of an hour in genuine hysterics. She   came close to me, put her arms round me and stayed motionless in that position. But the   trouble was that the hysterics could not go on for ever, and (I am writing the loathsome truth)   lying face downwards on the sofa with my face thrust into my nasty leather pillow, I began   by degrees to be aware of a far-away, involuntary but irresistible feeling that it would be  90",
    " awkward now for me to raise my head and look Liza straight in the face. Why was I   ashamed? I don’t know, but I was ashamed. The thought, too, came into my overwrought  brain that our parts now were completely changed, that she was now the heroine, while I was   just such a crushed and humiliated creature as she had been before me that night—four days   before.... And all this came into my mind during the minutes I was lying on my face on the  sofa.  My God! surely I was not envious of her then.   I don’t know, to this day I cannot decide, and at the time, of course, I was still less able to   understand what I was feeling than now. I cannot get on without domineering and tyrannizing   over some one, but ... there is no explaining anything by reasoning and so it is useless to   reason.  I conquered myself, however, and raised my head; I had to do so sooner or later ... and I am   convinced to this day that it was just because I was ashamed to look at her that another   feeling was suddenly kindled and flamed up in my heart ... a feeling of mastery and   possession. My eyes gleamed with passion, and I gripped her hands tightly. How I hated her   and how I was drawn to her at that minute! The one feeling intensified the other. It was   almost like an act of vengeance. At first there was a look of amazement, even of terror on her  face, but only for one instant. She warmly and rapturously embraced me.   X   A quarter of an hour later I was rushing up and down the room in frenzied impatience, from   minute to minute I went up to the screen and peeped through the crack at Liza. She was   sitting on the ground with her head leaning against the bed, and must have been crying. But   she did not go away, and that irritated me. This time she understood it all. I had insulted her   finally, but ... there’s no need to describe it. She realized that my outburst of passion had been   simply revenge, a fresh humiliation, and that to my earlier, almost causeless hatred was added   now a  personal hatred , born of envy.... Though I do not maintain positively that she   understood all this distinctly; but she certainly did fully understand that I was a despicable   man, and what was worse, incapable of loving her.   I know I shall be told that this is incredible—but it is incredible to be as spiteful and stupid as  I was; it may be added that it was strange I should not love her, or at any rate, appreciate her   love. Why is it strange? In the first place, by then I was incapable of love, for I repeat, with   me loving meant tyrannizing and showing my moral superiority. I have never in my life been   able to imagine any other sort of love, and have nowadays come to the point of sometimes   thinking that love really consists in the right—freely given by the beloved object—to   tyrannize over her.   Even in my underground dreams I did not imagine love except as a struggle. I began it always   with hatred and ended it with moral subjugation, and afterwards I never knew what to do with   the subjugated object. And what is there to wonder at in that, since I had succeeded in so   corrupting myself, since I was so out of touch with “real life,” as to have actually thought of  reproaching her, and putting her to shame for having come to me to hear “fine sentiments”;  and did not even guess that she had come not to hear fine sentiments, but to love me, because   to a woman all reformation, all salvation from any sort of ruin, and all moral renewal is   included in love and can only show itself in that form.   I did not hate her so much, however, when I was running about the room and peeping through   the crack in the screen. I was only insufferably oppressed by her being here. I wanted her to   disappear. I wanted “peace,” to be left alone in my underground world. Real life oppressed  me with its novelty so much that I could hardly breathe.  91",
    " But several minutes passed and she still remained, without stirring, as though she were   unconscious. I had the shamelessness to tap softly at the screen as though to remind her....   She started, sprang up, and flew to seek her kerchief, her hat, her coat, as though making her   escape from me.... Two minutes later she came from behind the screen and looked with heavy   eyes at me. I gave a spiteful grin, which was forced, however, to  keep up appearances , and I  turned away from her eyes.   “Good-bye,” she said, going towards the door.   I ran up to her, seized her hand, opened it, thrust something in it and closed it again. Then I   turned at once and dashed away in haste to the other corner of the room to avoid seeing,   anyway....   I did mean a moment since to tell a lie—to write that I did this accidentally, not knowing  what I was doing through foolishness, through losing my head. But I don’t want to lie, and so   I will say straight out that I opened her hand and put the money in it ... from spite. It came   into my head to do this while I was running up and down the room and she was sitting behind   the screen. But this I can say for certain: though I did that cruel thing purposely, it was not an   impulse from the heart, but came from my evil brain. This cruelty was so affected, so   purposely made up, so completely a product of the brain, of books, that I could not even keep   it up a minute—first I dashed away to avoid seeing her, and then in shame and despair rushed  after Liza. I opened the door in the passage and began listening.   “Liza! Liza!” I cried on the stairs, but in a low voice, not boldly.  There was no answer, but I fancied I heard her footsteps, lower down on the stairs.   “Liza!” I cried, more loudly.  No answer. But at that minute I heard the stiff outer glass door open heavily with a creak and   slam violently, the sound echoed up the stairs.   She had gone. I went back to my room in hesitation. I felt horribly oppressed.   I stood still at the table, beside the chair on which she had sat and looked aimlessly before   me. A minute passed, suddenly I started; straight before me on the table I saw.... In short, I   saw a crumpled blue five-rouble note, the one I had thrust into her hand a minute before. It   was the same note; it could be no other, there was no other in the flat. So she had managed to   fling it from her hand on the table at the moment when I had dashed into the further corner.   Well! I might have expected that she would do that. Might I have expected it? No, I was such   an egoist, I was so lacking in respect for my fellow-creatures that I could not even imagine  she would do so. I could not endure it. A minute later I flew like a madman to dress, flinging   on what I could at random and ran headlong after her. She could not have got two hundred   paces away when I ran out into the street.  It was a still night and the snow was coming down in masses and falling almost   perpendicularly, covering the pavement and the empty street as though with a pillow. There   was no one in the street, no sound was to be heard. The street lamps gave a disconsolate and  useless glimmer. I ran two hundred paces to the cross-roads and stopped short.   Where had she gone? And why was I running after her?   Why? To fall down before her, to sob with remorse, to kiss her feet, to entreat her   forgiveness! I longed for that, my whole breast was being rent to pieces, and never, never   shall I recall that minute with indifference. But—what for? I thought. Should I not begin to   hate her, perhaps, even to-morrow, just because I had kissed her feet to-day? Should I give  92",
    " her happiness? Had I not recognized that day, for the hundredth time, what I was worth?   Should I not torture her?   I stood in the snow, gazing into the troubled darkness and pondered this.   “And will it not be better?” I mused fantastically, afterwards at home, stifling the living pang  of my heart with fantastic dreams. “Will it not be better that she should keep the resentment  of the insult for ever? Resentment—why, it is purification; it is a most stinging and painful   consciousness! To-morrow I should have defiled her soul and have exhausted her heart, while   now the feeling of insult will never die in her heart, and however loathsome the filth awaiting  her—the feeling of insult will elevate and purify her ... by hatred ... h’m! ... perhaps, too, by  forgiveness.... Will all that make things easier for her though?...”   And, indeed, I will ask on my own account here, an idle question: which is better—cheap   happiness or exalted sufferings? Well, which is better?   So I dreamed as I sat at home that evening, almost dead with the pain in my soul. Never had I   endured such suffering and remorse, yet could there have been the faintest doubt when I ran   out from my lodging that I should turn back half-way? I never met Liza again and I have  heard nothing of her. I will add, too, that I remained for a long time afterwards pleased with   the phrase about the benefit from resentment and hatred in spite of the fact that I almost fell   ill from misery.  * * * * *   Even now, so many years later, all this is somehow a very evil memory. I have many evil   memories now, but ... hadn’t I better end my “Notes” here? I believe I made a mistake in  beginning to write them, anyway I have felt ashamed all the time I’ve been writing this story;   so it’s hardly literature so much as a corrective punishment. Why, to tell long stories,   showing how I have spoiled my life through morally rotting in my corner, through lack of   fitting environment, through divorce from real life, and rankling spite in my underground   world, would certainly not be interesting; a novel needs a hero, and all the traits for an anti-  hero are  expressly  gathered together here, and what matters most, it all produces an  unpleasant impression, for we are all divorced from life, we are all cripples, every one of us,   more or less. We are so divorced from it that we feel at once a sort of loathing for real life,   and so cannot bear to be reminded of it. Why, we have come almost to looking upon real life   as an effort, almost as hard work, and we are all privately agreed that it is better in books.   And why do we fuss and fume sometimes? Why are we perverse and ask for something else?   We don’t know what ourselves. It would be the worse for us if our petulant prayers were  answered. Come, try, give any one of us, for instance, a little more independence, untie our   hands, widen the spheres of our activity, relax the control and we ... yes, I assure you ... we   should be begging to be under control again at once. I know that you will very likely be angry   with me for that, and will begin shouting and stamping. Speak for yourself, you will say, and   for your miseries in your underground holes, and don’t dare to say all of us—excuse me,   gentlemen, I am not justifying myself with that “all of us.” As for what concerns me in   particular I have only in my life carried to an extreme what you have not dared to carry half-  way, and what’s more, you have taken your cowardice for good sense, and have found   comfort in deceiving yourselves. So that perhaps, after all, there is more life in me than in   you. Look into it more carefully! Why, we don’t even know what living means now, what it   is, and what it is called? Leave us alone without books and we shall be lost and in confusion   at once. We shall not know what to join on to, what to cling to, what to love and what to hate,   what to respect and what to despise. We are oppressed at being men—men with a real   individual body and blood, we are ashamed of it, we think it a disgrace and try to contrive to  93",
    " be some sort of impossible generalized man. We are stillborn, and for generations past have   been begotten, not by living fathers, and that suits us better and better. We are developing a   taste for it. Soon we shall contrive to be born somehow from an idea. But enough; I don’t  want to write more from “Underground.”  [ The notes of this paradoxalist do not end here, however. He could not refrain from going on  with them, but it seems to us that we may stop here. ]  94"

    " White Nights   FIRST NIGHT  It was a wonderful night, such a night as is only possible when we are young, dear reader.   The sky was so starry, so bright that, looking at it, one could not help asking oneself whether   ill-humoured and capricious people could live under such a sky. That is a youthful question   too, dear reader, very youthful, but may the Lord put it more frequently into your heart!...   Speaking of capricious and ill-humoured people, I cannot help recalling my moral condition   all that day. From early morning I had been oppressed by a strange despondency. It suddenly   seemed to me that I was lonely, that every one was forsaking me and going away from me.   Of course, any one is entitled to ask who “every one” was. For though I had been living   almost eight years in Petersburg I had hardly an acquaintance. But what did I want with   acquaintances? I was acquainted with all Petersburg as it was; that was why I felt as though   they were all deserting me when all Petersburg packed up and went to its summer villa. I felt   afraid of being left alone, and for three whole days I wandered about the town in profound   dejection, not knowing what to do with myself. Whether I walked in the Nevsky, went to the   Gardens or sauntered on the embankment, there was not one face of those I had been  accustomed to meet at the same time and place all the year. They, of course, do not know me,   but I know them. I know them intimately, I have almost made a study of their faces, and am   delighted when they are gay, and downcast when they are under a cloud. I have almost struck   up a friendship with one old man whom I meet every blessed day, at the same hour in   Fontanka. Such a grave, pensive countenance; he is always whispering to himself and   brandishing his left arm, while in his right hand he holds a long gnarled stick with a gold   knob. He even notices me and takes a warm interest in me. If I happen not to be at a certain   time in the same spot in Fontanka, I am certain he feels disappointed. That is how it is that we  almost bow to each other, especially when we are both in good humour. The other day, when   we had not seen each other for two days and met on the third, we were actually touching our   hats, but, realizing in time, dropped our hands and passed each other with a look of interest.   I know the houses too. As I walk along they seem to run forward in the streets to look out at   me from every window, and almost to say: “Good-morning! How do you do? I am quite well,   thank God, and I am to have a new storey in May,” or, “How are you? I am being redecorated  to-morrow;” or, “I was almost burnt down and had such a fright,” and so on. I have my  favourites among them, some are dear friends; one of them intends to be treated by the   architect this summer. I shall go every day on purpose to see that the operation is not a   failure. God forbid! But I shall never forget an incident with a very pretty little house of a   light pink colour. It was such a charming little brick house, it looked so hospitably at me, and   so proudly at its ungainly neighbours, that my heart rejoiced whenever I happened to pass it.   Suddenly last week I walked along the street, and when I looked at my friend I heard a   plaintive, “They are painting me yellow!” The villains! The barbarians! They had spared   nothing, neither columns, nor cornices, and my poor little friend was as yellow as a canary. It   almost made me bilious. And to this day I have not had the courage to visit my poor   disfigured friend, painted the colour of the Celestial Empire.  So now you understand, reader, in what sense I am acquainted with all Petersburg.   I have mentioned already that I had felt worried for three whole days before I guessed the   cause of my uneasiness. And I felt ill at ease in the street—this one had gone and that one had  gone, and what had become of the other?—and at home I did not feel like myself either. For  ",
    " two evenings I was puzzling my brains to think what was amiss in my corner; why I felt so   uncomfortable in it. And in perplexity I scanned my grimy green walls, my ceiling covered   with a spider’s web, the growth of which Matrona has so successfully encouraged. I looked   over all my furniture, examined every chair, wondering whether the trouble lay there (for if   one chair is not standing in the same position as it stood the day before, I am not myself). I  looked at the window, but it was all in vain ... I was not a bit the better for it! I even   bethought me to send for Matrona, and was giving her some fatherly admonitions in regard to   the spider’s web and sluttishness in general; but she simply stared at me in amazement and   went away without saying a word, so that the spider’s web is comfortably hanging in its place   to this day. I only at last this morning realized what was wrong. Aie! Why, they are giving   me the slip and making off to their summer villas! Forgive the triviality of the expression, but   I am in no mood for fine language ... for everything that had been in Petersburg had gone or   was going away for the holidays; for every respectable gentleman of dignified appearance   who took a cab was at once transformed, in my eyes, into a respectable head of a household   who after his daily duties were over, was making his way to the bosom of his family, to the   summer villa; for all the passers-by had now quite a peculiar air which seemed to say to every  one they met: “We are only here for the moment, gentlemen, and in another two hours we   shall be going off to the summer villa.” If a window opened after delicate fingers, white as  snow, had tapped upon the pane, and the head of a pretty girl was thrust out, calling to a   street-seller with pots of flowers—at once on the spot I fancied that those flowers were being  bought not simply in order to enjoy the flowers and the spring in stuffy town lodgings, but   because they would all be very soon moving into the country and could take the flowers with   them. What is more, I made such progress in my new peculiar sort of investigation that I   could distinguish correctly from the mere air of each in what summer villa he was living. The   inhabitants of Kamenny and Aptekarsky Islands or of the Peterhof Road were marked by the   studied elegance of their manner, their fashionable summer suits, and the fine carriages in   which they drove to town. Visitors to Pargolovo and places further away impressed one at   first sight by their reasonable and dignified air; the tripper to Krestovsky Island could be   recognized by his look of irrepressible gaiety. If I chanced to meet a long procession of   waggoners walking lazily with the reins in their hands beside waggons loaded with regular   mountains of furniture, tables, chairs, ottomans and sofas and domestic utensils of all sorts,   frequently with a decrepit cook sitting on the top of it all, guarding her master’s property as   though it were the apple of her eye; or if I saw boats heavily loaded with household goods   crawling along the Neva or Fontanka to the Black River or the Islands—the waggons and the   boats were multiplied tenfold, a hundredfold, in my eyes. I fancied that everything was astir   and moving, everything was going in regular caravans to the summer villas. It seemed as   though Petersburg threatened to become a wilderness, so that at last I felt ashamed, mortified   and sad that I had nowhere to go for the holidays and no reason to go away. I was ready to go   away with every waggon, to drive off with every gentleman of respectable appearance who   took a cab; but no one—absolutely no one—invited me; it seemed they had forgotten me, as   though really I were a stranger to them!   I took long walks, succeeding, as I usually did, in quite forgetting where I was, when I   suddenly found myself at the city gates. Instantly I felt lighthearted, and I passed the barrier   and walked between cultivated fields and meadows, unconscious of fatigue, and feeling only   all over as though a burden were falling off my soul. All the passers-by gave me such friendly   looks that they seemed almost greeting me, they all seemed so pleased at something. They   were all smoking cigars, every one of them. And I felt pleased as I never had before. It was as  though I had suddenly found myself in Italy—so strong was the effect of nature upon a half-  sick townsman like me, almost stifling between city walls.  ",
    " There is something inexpressibly touching in nature round Petersburg, when at the approach   of spring she puts forth all her might, all the powers bestowed on her by Heaven, when she   breaks into leaf, decks herself out and spangles herself with flowers.... Somehow I cannot   help being reminded of a frail, consumptive girl, at whom one sometimes looks with   compassion, sometimes with sympathetic love, whom sometimes one simply does not notice;   though suddenly in one instant she becomes, as though by chance, inexplicably lovely and   exquisite, and, impressed and intoxicated, one cannot help asking oneself what power made   those sad, pensive eyes flash with such fire? What summoned the blood to those pale, wan   cheeks? What bathed with passion those soft features? What set that bosom heaving? What so  suddenly called strength, life and beauty into the poor girl’s face, making it gleam with such a   smile, kindle with such bright, sparkling laughter? You look round, you seek for some one,   you conjecture.... But the moment passes, and next day you meet, maybe, the same pensive   and preoccupied look as before, the same pale face, the same meek and timid movements,   and even signs of remorse, traces of a mortal anguish and regret for the fleeting distraction....   And you grieve that the momentary beauty has faded so soon never to return, that it flashed   upon you so treacherously, so vainly, grieve because you had not even time to love her....   And yet my night was better than my day! This was how it happened.   I came back to the town very late, and it had struck ten as I was going towards my lodgings.   My way lay along the canal embankment, where at that hour you never meet a soul. It is true   that I live in a very remote part of the town. I walked along singing, for when I am happy I   am always humming to myself like every happy man who has no friend or acquaintance with   whom to share his joy. Suddenly I had a most unexpected adventure.   Leaning on the canal railing stood a woman with her elbows on the rail, she was apparently   looking with great attention at the muddy water of the canal. She was wearing a very   charming yellow hat and a jaunty little black mantle. “She’s a girl, and I am sure she is dark,”   I thought. She did not seem to hear my footsteps, and did not even stir when I passed by with   bated breath and loudly throbbing heart.   “Strange,” I thought; “she must be deeply absorbed in something,” and all at once I stopped  as though petrified. I heard a muffled sob. Yes! I was not mistaken, the girl was crying, and a   minute later I heard sob after sob. Good Heavens! My heart sank. And timid as I was with   women, yet this was such a moment!... I turned, took a step towards her, and should certainly   have pronounced the word “Madam!” if I had not known that that exclamation has been  uttered a thousand times in every Russian society novel. It was only that reflection stopped   me. But while I was seeking for a word, the girl came to herself, looked round, started, cast   down her eyes and slipped by me along the embankment. I at once followed her; but she,   divining this, left the embankment, crossed the road and walked along the pavement. I dared   not cross the street after her. My heart was fluttering like a captured bird. All at once a chance  came to my aid.  Along the same side of the pavement there suddenly came into sight, not far from the girl, a   gentleman in evening dress, of dignified years, though by no means of dignified carriage; he   was staggering and cautiously leaning against the wall. The girl flew straight as an arrow,   with the timid haste one sees in all girls who do not want any one to volunteer to accompany   them home at night, and no doubt the staggering gentleman would not have pursued her, if   my good luck had not prompted him.   Suddenly, without a word to any one, the gentleman set off and flew full speed in pursuit of   my unknown lady. She was racing like the wind, but the staggering gentleman was   overtaking—overtook her. The girl uttered a shriek, and ... I bless my luck for the excellent  ",
    " knotted stick, which happened on that occasion to be in my right hand. In a flash I was on the   other side of the street; in a flash the obtrusive gentleman had taken in the position, had   grasped the irresistible argument, fallen back without a word, and only when we were very   far away protested against my action in rather vigorous language. But his words hardly   reached us.  “Give me your arm,” I said to the girl. “And he won’t dare to annoy us further.”   She took my arm without a word, still trembling with excitement and terror. Oh, obtrusive   gentleman! How I blessed you at that moment! I stole a glance at her, she was very charming   and dark—I had guessed right.   On her black eyelashes there still glistened a tear—from her recent terror or her former  grief—I don’t know. But there was already a gleam of a smile on her lips. She too stole a  glance at me, faintly blushed and looked down.   “There, you see; why did you drive me away? If I had been here, nothing would have   happened....”   “But I did not know you; I thought that you too....”   “Why, do you know me now?”   “A little! Here, for instance, why are you trembling?”   “Oh, you are right at the first guess!” I answered, delighted that my girl had intelligence; that   is never out of place in company with beauty. “Yes, from the first glance you have guessed   the sort of man you have to do with. Precisely; I am shy with women, I am agitated, I don’t  deny it, as much so as you were a minute ago when that gentleman alarmed you. I am in   some alarm now. It’s like a dream, and I never guessed even in my sleep that I should ever   talk with any woman.”   “What? Really?...”  “Yes; if my arm trembles, it is because it has never been held by a pretty little hand like  yours. I am a complete stranger to women; that is, I have never been used to them. You see, I   am alone.... I don’t even know how to talk to them. Here, I don’t know now whether I have   not said something silly to you! Tell me frankly; I assure you beforehand that I am not quick   to take offence?...”  “No, nothing, nothing, quite the contrary. And if you insist on my speaking frankly, I will tell   you that women like such timidity; and if you want to know more, I like it too, and I won’t  drive you away till I get home.”   “You will make me,” I said, breathless with delight, “lose my timidity, and then farewell to  all my chances....”   “Chances! What chances—of what? That’s not so nice.”  “I beg your pardon, I am sorry, it was a slip of the tongue; but how can you expect one at   such a moment to have no desire....”   “To be liked, eh?”   “Well, yes; but do, for goodness’ sake, be kind. Think what I am! Here, I am twenty-six and I   have never seen any one. How can I speak well, tactfully, and to the point? It will seem better   to you when I have told you everything openly.... I don’t know how to be silent when my   heart is speaking. Well, never mind.... Believe me, not one woman, never, never! No  ",
    " acquaintance of any sort! And I do nothing but dream every day that at last I shall meet some   one. Oh, if only you knew how often I have been in love in that way....”   “How? With whom?...”   “Why, with no one, with an ideal, with the one I dream of in my sleep. I make up regular   romances in my dreams. Ah, you don’t know me! It’s true, of course, I have met two or three  women, but what sort of women were they? They were all landladies, that.... But I shall make   you laugh if I tell you that I have several times thought of speaking, just simply speaking, to   some aristocratic lady in the street, when she is alone, I need hardly say; speaking to her, of  course, timidly, respectfully, passionately; telling her that I am perishing in solitude, begging   her not to send me away; saying that I have no chance of making the acquaintance of any   woman; impressing upon her that it is a positive duty for a woman not to repulse so timid a   prayer from such a luckless man as me. That, in fact, all I ask is, that she should say two or   three sisterly words with sympathy, should not repulse me at first sight; should take me on   trust and listen to what I say; should laugh at me if she likes, encourage me, say two words to   me, only two words, even though we never meet again afterwards!... But you are laughing;   however, that is why I am telling you....”   “Don’t be vexed; I am only laughing at your being your own enemy, and if you had tried you  would have succeeded, perhaps, even though it had been in the street; the simpler the better....   No kind-hearted woman, unless she were stupid or, still more, vexed about something at the   moment, could bring herself to send you away without those two words which you ask for so   timidly.... But what am I saying? Of course she would take you for a madman. I was judging   by myself; I know a good deal about other people’s lives.”  “Oh, thank you,” I cried; “you don’t know what you have done for me now!”  “I am glad! I am glad! But tell me how did you find out that I was the sort of woman with   whom ... well, whom you think worthy ... of attention and friendship ... in fact, not a landlady   as you say? What made you decide to come up to me?”   “What made me?... But you were alone; that gentleman was too insolent; it’s night. You must   admit that it was a duty....”   “No, no; I mean before, on the other side—you know you meant to come up to me.”   “On the other side? Really I don’t know how to answer; I am afraid to.... Do you know I have   been happy to-day? I walked along singing; I went out into the country; I have never had   such happy moments. You ... perhaps it was my fancy.... Forgive me for referring to it; I   fancied you were crying, and I ... could not bear to hear it ... it made my heart ache.... Oh, my   goodness! Surely I might be troubled about you? Surely there was no harm in feeling   brotherly compassion for you.... I beg your pardon, I said compassion.... Well, in short, surely   you would not be offended at my involuntary impulse to go up to you?...”   “Stop, that’s enough, don’t talk of it,” said the girl, looking down, and pressing my hand.  “It’s my fault for having spoken of it; but I am glad I was not mistaken in you.... But here I  am home; I must go down this turning, it’s two steps from here.... Good-bye, thank you!...”   “Surely ... surely you don’t mean ... that we shall never see each other again?... Surely this is   not to be the end?”   “You see,” said the girl, laughing, “at first you only wanted two words, and now.... However,  I won’t say anything ... perhaps we shall meet....”  “I shall come here to-morrow,” I said. “Oh, forgive me, I am already making demands....”  ",
    " “Yes, you are not very patient ... you are almost insisting.”   “Listen, listen!” I interrupted her. “Forgive me if I tell you something else.... I tell you what, I  can’t help coming here to-morrow, I am a dreamer; I have so little real life that I look upon  such moments as this now, as so rare, that I cannot help going over such moments again in   my dreams. I shall be dreaming of you all night, a whole week, a whole year. I shall certainly  come here to-morrow, just here to this place, just at the same hour, and I shall be happy  remembering to-day. This place is dear to me already. I have already two or three such places  in Petersburg. I once shed tears over memories ... like you.... Who knows, perhaps you were   weeping ten minutes ago over some memory.... But, forgive me, I have forgotten myself   again; perhaps you have once been particularly happy here....”   “Very good,” said the girl, “perhaps I will come here to-morrow, too, at ten o’clock. I see that  I can’t forbid you.... The fact is, I have to be here; don’t imagine that I am making an  appointment with you; I tell you beforehand that I have to be here on my own account. But ...   well, I tell you straight out, I don’t mind if you do come. To begin with, something   unpleasant might happen as it did to-day, but never mind that.... In short, I should simply like   to see you ... to say two words to you. Only, mind, you must not think the worse of me now!   Don’t think I make appointments so lightly.... I shouldn’t make it except that.... But let that be  my secret! Only a compact beforehand....”   “A compact! Speak, tell me, tell me all beforehand; I agree to anything, I am ready for   anything,” I cried delighted. “I answer for myself, I will be obedient, respectful ... you know   me....”   “It’s just because I do know you that I ask you to come to-morrow,” said the girl, laughing. “I  know you perfectly. But mind you will come on the condition, in the first place (only be   good, do what I ask—you see, I speak frankly), you won’t fall in love with me.... That’s  impossible, I assure you. I am ready for friendship; here’s my hand.... But you mustn’t fall in  love with me, I beg you!”   “I swear,” I cried, gripping her hand....  “Hush, don’t swear, I know you are ready to flare up like gunpowder. Don’t think ill of me  for saying so. If only you knew.... I, too, have no one to whom I can say a word, whose   advice I can ask. Of course, one does not look for an adviser in the street; but you are an   exception. I know you as though we had been friends for twenty years.... You won’t deceive  me, will you?...”   “You will see ... the only thing is, I don’t know how I am going to survive the next twenty-  four hours.”   “Sleep soundly. Good-night, and remember that I have trusted you already. But you   exclaimed so nicely just now, ‘Surely one can’t be held responsible for every feeling, even   for brotherly sympathy!’ Do you know, that was so nicely said, that the idea struck me at   once, that I might confide in you?”   “For God’s sake do; but about what? What is it?”  “Wait till to-morrow. Meanwhile, let that be a secret. So much the better for you; it will give  it a faint flavour of romance. Perhaps I will tell you to-morrow, and perhaps not.... I will talk   to you a little more beforehand; we will get to know each other better....”   “Oh yes, I will tell you all about myself to-morrow! But what has happened? It is as though a  miracle had befallen me.... My God, where am I? Come, tell me aren’t you glad that you were  not angry and did not drive me away at the first moment, as any other woman would have  ",
    " done? In two minutes you have made me happy for ever. Yes, happy; who knows, perhaps,   you have reconciled me with myself, solved my doubts!... Perhaps such moments come upon   me.... But there I will tell you all about it to-morrow, you shall know everything,  everything....”   “Very well, I consent; you shall begin....”   “Agreed.”   “Good-bye till to-morrow!”  “Till to-morrow!”  And we parted. I walked about all night; I could not make up my mind to go home. I was so   happy.... To-morrow!  SECOND NIGHT  “Well, so you have survived!” she said, pressing both my hands.   “I’ve been here for the last two hours; you don’t know what a state I have been in all day.”  “I know, I know. But to business. Do you know why I have come? Not to talk nonsense, as I   did yesterday. I tell you what, we must behave more sensibly in future. I thought a great deal   about it last night.”  “In what way—in what must we be more sensible? I am ready for my part; but, really,  nothing more sensible has happened to me in my life than this, now.”   “Really? In the first place, I beg you not to squeeze my hands so; secondly, I must tell you   that I spent a long time thinking about you and feeling doubtful to-day.”   “And how did it end?”   “How did it end? The upshot of it is that we must begin all over again, because the   conclusion I reached to-day was that I don’t know you at all; that I behaved like a baby last   night, like a little girl; and, of course, the fact of it is, that it’s my soft heart that is to blame— that is, I sang my own praises, as one always does in the end when one analyses one’s  conduct. And therefore to correct my mistake, I’ve made up my mind to find out all about   you minutely. But as I have no one from whom I can find out anything, you must tell me   everything fully yourself. Well, what sort of man are you? Come, make haste—begin—tell   me your whole history.”   “My history!” I cried in alarm. “My history! But who has told you I have a history? I have no  history....”   “Then how have you lived, if you have no history?” she interrupted, laughing.   “Absolutely without any history! I have lived, as they say, keeping myself to myself, that is,   utterly alone—alone, entirely alone. Do you know what it means to be alone?”   “But how alone? Do you mean you never saw any one?”   “Oh no, I see people, of course; but still I am alone.”   “Why, do you never talk to any one?”   “Strictly speaking, with no one.”   “Who are you then? Explain yourself! Stay, I guess: most likely, like me you have a   grandmother. She is blind and will never let me go anywhere, so that I have almost forgotten   how to talk; and when I played some pranks two years ago, and she saw there was no holding  7",
    " me in, she called me up and pinned my dress to hers, and ever since we sit like that for days   together; she knits a stocking, though she’s blind, and I sit beside her, sew or read aloud to   her—it’s such a queer habit, here for two years I’ve been pinned to her....”  “Good Heavens! what misery! But no, I haven’t a grandmother like that.”   “Well, if you haven’t why do you sit at home?...”   “Listen, do you want to know the sort of man I am?”   “Yes, yes!”  “In the strict sense of the word?”   “In the very strictest sense of the word.”   “Very well, I am a type!”  “Type, type! What sort of type?” cried the girl, laughing, as though she had not had a chance   of laughing for a whole year. “Yes, it’s very amusing talking to you. Look, here’s a seat, let  us sit down. No one is passing here, no one will hear us, and—begin your history. For it’s no   good your telling me, I know you have a history; only you are concealing it. To begin with,   what is a type?”   “A type? A type is an original, it’s an absurd person!” I said, infected by her childish   laughter. “It’s a character. Listen; do you know what is meant by a dreamer?”  “A dreamer! Indeed I should think I do know. I am a dreamer myself. Sometimes, as I sit by   grandmother, all sorts of things come into my head. Why, when one begins dreaming one lets   one’s fancy run away with one—why, I marry a Chinese Prince!... Though sometimes it is a   good thing to dream! But, goodness knows! Especially when one has something to think of   apart from dreams,” added the girl, this time rather seriously.  “Excellent! If you have been married to a Chinese Emperor, you will quite understand me.   Come, listen.... But one minute, I don’t know your name yet.”   “At last! You have been in no hurry to think of it!”   “Oh, my goodness! It never entered my head, I felt quite happy as it was....”   “My name is Nastenka.”  “Nastenka! And nothing else?”   “Nothing else! Why, is not that enough for you, you insatiable person?”   “Not enough? On the contrary, it’s a great deal, a very great deal, Nastenka; you kind girl, if   you are Nastenka for me from the first.”   “Quite so! Well?”  “Well, listen, Nastenka, now for this absurd history.”   I sat down beside her, assumed a pedantically serious attitude, and began as though reading   from a manuscript:—   “There are, Nastenka, though you may not know it, strange nooks in Petersburg. It seems as   though the same sun as shines for all Petersburg people does not peep into those spots, but   some other different new one, bespoken expressly for those nooks, and it throws a different   light on everything. In these corners, dear Nastenka, quite a different life is lived, quite unlike   the life that is surging round us, but such as perhaps exists in some unknown realm, not   among us in our serious, over-serious, time. Well, that life is a mixture of something purely  8",
    " fantastic, fervently ideal, with something (alas! Nastenka) dingily prosaic and ordinary, not to   say incredibly vulgar.”   “Foo! Good Heavens! What a preface! What do I hear?”   “Listen, Nastenka. (It seems to me I shall never be tired of calling you Nastenka.) Let me tell   you that in these corners live strange people—dreamers. The dreamer—if you want an exact  definition—is not a human being, but a creature of an intermediate sort. For the most part he  settles in some inaccessible corner, as though hiding from the light of day; once he slips into   his corner, he grows to it like a snail, or, anyway, he is in that respect very much like that   remarkable creature, which is an animal and a house both at once, and is called a tortoise.  Why do you suppose he is so fond of his four walls, which are invariably painted green,   grimy, dismal and reeking unpardonably of tobacco smoke? Why is it that when this absurd   gentleman is visited by one of his few acquaintances (and he ends by getting rid of all his   friends), why does this absurd person meet him with such embarrassment, changing   countenance and overcome with confusion, as though he had only just committed some crime   within his four walls; as though he had been forging counterfeit notes, or as though he were  writing verses to be sent to a journal with an anonymous letter, in which he states that the real   poet is dead, and that his friend thinks it his sacred duty to publish his things? Why, tell me,  Nastenka, why is it conversation is not easy between the two friends? Why is there no   laughter? Why does no lively word fly from the tongue of the perplexed newcomer, who at   other times may be very fond of laughter, lively words, conversation about the fair sex, and   other cheerful subjects? And why does this friend, probably a new friend and on his first   visit—for there will hardly be a second, and the friend will never come again—why is the   friend himself so confused, so tongue-tied, in spite of his wit (if he has any), as he looks at   the downcast face of his host, who in his turn becomes utterly helpless and at his wits’ end   after gigantic but fruitless efforts to smooth things over and enliven the conversation, to show   his knowledge of polite society, to talk, too, of the fair sex, and by such humble endeavour, to   please the poor man, who like a fish out of water has mistakenly come to visit him? Why  does the gentleman, all at once remembering some very necessary business which never   existed, suddenly seize his hat and hurriedly make off, snatching away his hand from the   warm grip of his host, who was trying his utmost to show his regret and retrieve the lost   position? Why does the friend chuckle as he goes out of the door, and swear never to come   and see this queer creature again, though the queer creature is really a very good fellow, and   at the same time he cannot refuse his imagination the little diversion of comparing the queer  fellow’s countenance during their conversation with the expression of an unhappy kitten  treacherously captured, roughly handled, frightened and subjected to all sorts of indignities   by children, till, utterly crestfallen, it hides away from them under a chair in the dark, and   there must needs at its leisure bristle up, spit, and wash its insulted face with both paws, and   long afterwards look angrily at life and nature, and even at the bits saved from the master’s  dinner for it by the sympathetic housekeeper?”   “Listen,” interrupted Nastenka, who had listened to me all the time in amazement, opening  her eyes and her little mouth. “Listen; I don’t know in the least why it happened and why you   ask me such absurd questions; all I know is, that this adventure must have happened word for   word to you.”   “Doubtless,” I answered, with the gravest face.  “Well, since there is no doubt about it, go on,” said Nastenka, “because I want very much to   know how it will end.”  ",
    " “You want to know, Nastenka, what our hero, that is I—for the hero of the whole business   was my humble self—did in his corner? You want to know why I lost my head and was upset   for the whole day by the unexpected visit of a friend? You want to know why I was so  startled, why I blushed when the door of my room was opened, why I was not able to   entertain my visitor, and why I was crushed under the weight of my own hospitality?”   “Why, yes, yes,” answered Nastenka, “that’s the point. Listen. You describe it all splendidly,  but couldn’t you perhaps describe it a little less splendidly? You talk as though you were   reading it out of a book.”   “Nastenka,” I answered in a stern and dignified voice, hardly able to keep from laughing,  “dear Nastenka, I know I describe splendidly, but, excuse me, I don’t know how else to do it.   At this moment, dear Nastenka, at this moment I am like the spirit of King Solomon when,   after lying a thousand years under seven seals in his urn, those seven seals were at last taken   off. At this moment, Nastenka, when we have met at last after such a long separation—for I  have known you for ages, Nastenka, because I have been looking for some one for ages, and   that is a sign that it was you I was looking for, and it was ordained that we should meet   now—at this moment a thousand valves have opened in my head, and I must let myself flow   in a river of words, or I shall choke. And so I beg you not to interrupt me, Nastenka, but listen   humbly and obediently, or I will be silent.”   “No, no, no! Not at all. Go on! I won’t say a word!”   “I will continue. There is, my friend Nastenka, one hour in my day which I like extremely.   That is the hour when almost all business, work and duties are over, and every one is   hurrying home to dinner, to lie down, to rest, and on the way all are cogitating on other more   cheerful subjects relating to their evenings, their nights, and all the rest of their free time. At   that hour our hero—for allow me, Nastenka, to tell my story in the third person, for one feels   awfully ashamed to tell it in the first person—and so at that hour our hero, who had his work  too, was pacing along after the others. But a strange feeling of pleasure set his pale, rather   crumpled-looking face working. He looked not with indifference on the evening glow which  was slowly fading on the cold Petersburg sky. When I say he looked, I am lying: he did not   look at it, but saw it as it were without realizing, as though tired or preoccupied with some   other more interesting subject, so that he could scarcely spare a glance for anything about   him. He was pleased because till next day he was released from business irksome to him, and   happy as a schoolboy let out from the class-room to his games and mischief. Take a look at   him, Nastenka; you will see at once that joyful emotion has already had an effect on his weak   nerves and morbidly excited fancy. You see he is thinking of something.... Of dinner, do you   imagine? Of the evening? What is he looking at like that? Is it at that gentleman of dignified   appearance who is bowing so picturesquely to the lady who rolls by in a carriage drawn by   prancing horses? No, Nastenka; what are all those trivialities to him now! He is rich now with   his  own individual  life; he has suddenly become rich, and it is not for nothing that the fading  sunset sheds its farewell gleams so gaily before him, and calls forth a swarm of impressions   from his warmed heart. Now he hardly notices the road, on which the tiniest details at other   times would strike him. Now ‘the Goddess of Fancy’ (if you have read Zhukovsky, dear   Nastenka) has already with fantastic hand spun her golden warp and begun weaving upon it   patterns of marvellous magic life—and who knows, maybe, her fantastic hand has borne him  to the seventh crystal heaven far from the excellent granite pavement on which he was   walking his way? Try stopping him now, ask him suddenly where he is standing now,   through what streets he is going—he will, probably remember nothing, neither where he is   going nor where he is standing now, and flushing with vexation he will certainly tell some lie  to save appearances. That is why he starts, almost cries out, and looks round with horror  10",
    " when a respectable old lady stops him politely in the middle of the pavement and asks her   way. Frowning with vexation he strides on, scarcely noticing that more than one passer-by   smiles and turns round to look after him, and that a little girl, moving out of his way in alarm,   laughs aloud, gazing open-eyed at his broad meditative smile and gesticulations. But fancy   catches up in its playful flight the old woman, the curious passers-by, and the laughing child,   and the peasants spending their nights in their barges on Fontanka (our hero, let us suppose, is   walking along the canal-side at that moment), and capriciously weaves every one and   everything into the canvas like a fly in a spider’s web. And it is only after the queer fellow   has returned to his comfortable den with fresh stores for his mind to work on, has sat down   and finished his dinner, that he comes to himself, when Matrona who waits upon him—  always thoughtful and depressed—clears the table and gives him his pipe; he comes to   himself then and recalls with surprise that he has dined, though he has absolutely no notion   how it has happened. It has grown dark in the room; his soul is sad and empty; the whole   kingdom of fancies drops to pieces about him, drops to pieces without a trace, without a   sound, floats away like a dream, and he cannot himself remember what he was dreaming. But   a vague sensation faintly stirs his heart and sets it aching, some new desire temptingly tickles   and excites his fancy, and imperceptibly evokes a swarm of fresh phantoms. Stillness reigns   in the little room; imagination is fostered by solitude and idleness; it is faintly smouldering,   faintly simmering, like the water with which old Matrona is making her coffee as she moves  quietly about in the kitchen close by. Now it breaks out spasmodically; and the book, picked   up aimlessly and at random, drops from my dreamer’s hand before he has reached the third  page. His imagination is again stirred and at work, and again a new world, a new fascinating   life opens vistas before him. A fresh dream—fresh happiness! A fresh rush of delicate,   voluptuous poison! What is real life to him! To his corrupted eyes we live, you and I,   Nastenka, so torpidly, slowly, insipidly; in his eyes we are all so dissatisfied with our fate, so   exhausted by our life! And, truly, see how at first sight everything is cold, morose, as though   ill-humoured among us.... Poor things! thinks our dreamer. And it is no wonder that he thinks   it! Look at these magic phantasms, which so enchantingly, so whimsically, so carelessly and   freely group before him in such a magic, animated picture, in which the most prominent   figure in the foreground is of course himself, our dreamer, in his precious person. See what   varied adventures, what an endless swarm of ecstatic dreams. You ask, perhaps, what he is   dreaming of. Why ask that?—why, of everything ... of the lot of the poet, first unrecognized,   then crowned with laurels; of friendship with Hoffmann, St. Bartholomew’s Night, of Diana   Vernon, of playing the hero at the taking of Kazan by Ivan Vassilyevitch, of Clara Mowbray,   of Effie Deans, of the council of the prelates and Huss before them, of the rising of the dead   in ‘Robert the Devil’ (do you remember the music, it smells of the churchyard!), of Minna   and Brenda, of the battle of Berezina, of the reading of a poem at Countess V. D.’s, of   Danton, of Cleopatra  ei suoi amanti , of a little house in Kolomna, of a little home of one’s  own and beside one a dear creature who listens to one on a winter’s evening, opening her   little mouth and eyes as you are listening to me now, my angel.... No, Nastenka, what is there,   what is there for him, voluptuous sluggard, in this life, for which you and I have such a   longing? He thinks that this is a poor pitiful life, not foreseeing that for him too, maybe,   sometime the mournful hour may strike, when for one day of that pitiful life he would give all   his years of phantasy, and would give them not only for joy and for happiness, but without   caring to make distinctions in that hour of sadness, remorse and unchecked grief. But so far   that threatening has not arrived—he desires nothing, because he is superior to all desire,   because he has everything, because he is satiated, because he is the artist of his own life, and  creates it for himself every hour to suit his latest whim. And you know this fantastic world of   fairyland is so easily, so naturally created! As though it were not a delusion! Indeed, he is   ready to believe at some moments that all this life is not suggested by feeling, is not mirage,  11",
    " not a delusion of the imagination, but that it is concrete, real, substantial! Why is it, Nastenka,   why is it at such moments one holds one’s breath? Why, by what sorcery, through what   incomprehensible caprice, is the pulse quickened, does a tear start from the dreamer’s eye,  while his pale moist cheeks glow, while his whole being is suffused with an inexpressible   sense of consolation? Why is it that whole sleepless nights pass like a flash in inexhaustible   gladness and happiness, and when the dawn gleams rosy at the window and daybreak floods   the gloomy room with uncertain, fantastic light, as in Petersburg, our dreamer, worn out and   exhausted, flings himself on his bed and drops asleep with thrills of delight in his morbidly   overwrought spirit, and with a weary sweet ache in his heart? Yes, Nastenka, one deceives  oneself and unconsciously believes that real true passion is stirring one’s soul; one   unconsciously believes that there is something living, tangible in one’s immaterial dreams!  And is it delusion? Here love, for instance, is bound up with all its fathomless joy, all its   torturing agonies in his bosom.... Only look at him, and you will be convinced! Would you   believe, looking at him, dear Nastenka, that he has never known her whom he loves in his   ecstatic dreams? Can it be that he has only seen her in seductive visions, and that this passion   has been nothing but a dream? Surely they must have spent years hand in hand together—  alone the two of them, casting off all the world and each uniting his or her life with the   other’s? Surely when the hour of parting came she must have lain sobbing and grieving on his   bosom, heedless of the tempest raging under the sullen sky, heedless of the wind which   snatches and bears away the tears from her black eyelashes? Can all of that have been a   dream—and that garden, dejected, forsaken, run wild, with its little moss-grown paths,  solitary, gloomy, where they used to walk so happily together, where they hoped, grieved,   loved, loved each other so long, “so long and so fondly?” And that queer ancestral house   where she spent so many years lonely and sad with her morose old husband, always silent   and splenetic, who frightened them, while timid as children they hid their love from each   other? What torments they suffered, what agonies of terror, how innocent, how pure was their   love, and how (I need hardly say, Nastenka) malicious people were! And, good Heavens!   surely he met her afterwards, far from their native shores, under alien skies, in the hot south   in the divinely eternal city, in the dazzling splendour of the ball to the crash of music, in  a  palazzo  (it must be in a  palazzo ), drowned in a sea of lights, on the balcony, wreathed in  myrtle and roses, where, recognizing him, she hurriedly removes her mask and whispering, ‘I  am free,’ flings herself trembling into his arms, and with a cry of rapture, clinging to one  another, in one instant they forget their sorrow and their parting and all their agonies, and the   gloomy house and the old man and the dismal garden in that distant land, and the seat on   which with a last passionate kiss she tore herself away from his arms numb with anguish and   despair.... Oh, Nastenka, you must admit that one would start, betray confusion, and blush   like a schoolboy who has just stuffed in his pocket an apple stolen from a neighbour’s garden,   when your uninvited visitor, some stalwart, lanky fellow, a festive soul fond of a joke, opens   your door and shouts out as though nothing were happening: ‘My dear boy, I have this   minute come from Pavlovsk.’ My goodness! the old count is dead, unutterable happiness is   close at hand—and people arrive from Pavlovsk!”  Finishing my pathetic appeal, I paused pathetically. I remembered that I had an intense desire   to force myself to laugh, for I was already feeling that a malignant demon was stirring within   me, that there was a lump in my throat, that my chin was beginning to twitch, and that my   eyes were growing more and more moist.   I expected Nastenka, who listened to me opening her clever eyes, would break into her   childish, irrepressible laugh; and I was already regretting that I had gone so far, that I had   unnecessarily described what had long been simmering in my heart, about which I could   speak as though from a written account of it, because I had long ago passed judgment on  12",
    " myself and now could not resist reading it, making my confession, without expecting to be   understood; but to my surprise she was silent, waiting a little, then she faintly pressed my   hand and with timid sympathy asked—   “Surely you haven’t lived like that all your life?”  “All my life, Nastenka,” I answered; “all my life, and it seems to me I shall go on so to the  end.”   “No, that won’t do,” she said uneasily, “that must not be; and so, maybe, I shall spend all my   life beside grandmother. Do you know, it is not at all good to live like that?”   “I know, Nastenka, I know!” I cried, unable to restrain my feelings longer. “And I realize  now, more than ever, that I have lost all my best years! And now I know it and feel it more   painfully from recognizing that God has sent me you, my good angel, to tell me that and   show it. Now that I sit beside you and talk to you it is strange for me to think of the future, for   in the future—there is loneliness again, again this musty, useless life; and what shall I have to   dream of when I have been so happy in reality beside you! Oh, may you be blessed, dear girl,   for not having repulsed me at first, for enabling me to say that for two evenings, at least, I   have lived.”   “Oh, no, no!” cried Nastenka and tears glistened in her eyes. “No, it mustn’t be so any more;  we must not part like that! what are two evenings?”   “Oh, Nastenka, Nastenka! Do you know how far you have reconciled me to myself? Do you   know now that I shall not think so ill of myself, as I have at some moments? Do you know   that, maybe, I shall leave off grieving over the crime and sin of my life? for such a life is a  crime and a sin. And do not imagine that I have been exaggerating anything—for goodness’   sake don’t think that, Nastenka: for at times such misery comes over me, such misery....   Because it begins to seem to me at such times that I am incapable of beginning a life in real   life, because it has seemed to me that I have lost all touch, all instinct for the actual, the real;  because at last I have cursed myself; because after my fantastic nights I have moments of   returning sobriety, which are awful! Meanwhile, you hear the whirl and roar of the crowd in   the vortex of life around you; you hear, you see, men living in reality; you see that life for  them is not forbidden, that their life does not float away like a dream, like a vision; that their   life is being eternally renewed, eternally youthful, and not one hour of it is the same as   another; while fancy is so spiritless, monotonous to vulgarity and easily scared, the slave of   shadows, of the idea, the slave of the first cloud that shrouds the sun, and overcasts with   depression the true Petersburg heart so devoted to the sun—and what is fancy in depression!   One feels that this  inexhaustible  fancy is weary at last and worn out with continual exercise,  because one is growing into manhood, outgrowing one’s old ideals: they are being shattered   into fragments, into dust; if there is no other life one must build one up from the fragments.   And meanwhile the soul longs and craves for something else! And in vain the dreamer rakes   over his old dreams, as though seeking a spark among the embers, to fan them into flame, to   warm his chilled heart by the rekindled fire, and to rouse up in it again all that was so sweet,   that touched his heart, that set his blood boiling, drew tears from his eyes, and so luxuriously   deceived him! Do you know, Nastenka, the point I have reached? Do you know that I am   forced now to celebrate the anniversary of my own sensations, the anniversary of that which   was once so sweet, which never existed in reality—for this anniversary is kept in memory of  those same foolish, shadowy dreams—and to do this because those foolish dreams are no   more, because I have nothing to earn them with; you know even dreams do not come for   nothing! Do you know that I love now to recall and visit at certain dates the places where I   was once happy in my own way? I love to build up my present in harmony with the  13",
    " irrevocable past, and I often wander like a shadow, aimless, sad and dejected, about the   streets and crooked lanes of Petersburg. What memories they are! To remember, for instance,   that here just a year ago, just at this time, at this hour, on this pavement, I wandered just as   lonely, just as dejected as to-day. And one remembers that then one’s dreams were sad, and  though the past was no better one feels as though it had somehow been better, and that life   was more peaceful, that one was free from the black thoughts that haunt one now; that one   was free from the gnawing of conscience—the gloomy, sullen gnawing which now gives me   no rest by day or by night. And one asks oneself where are one’s dreams. And one shakes   one’s head and says how rapidly the years fly by! And again one asks oneself what has one   done with one’s years. Where have you buried your best days? Have you lived or not? Look,   one says to oneself, look how cold the world is growing. Some more years will pass, and after   them will come gloomy solitude; then will come old age trembling on its crutch, and after it  misery and desolation. Your fantastic world will grow pale, your dreams will fade and die   and will fall like the yellow leaves from the trees.... Oh, Nastenka! you know it will be sad to   be left alone, utterly alone, and to have not even anything to regret—nothing, absolutely  nothing ... for all that you have lost, all that, all was nothing, stupid, simple nullity, there has   been nothing but dreams!”   “Come, don’t work on my feelings any more,” said Nastenka, wiping away a tear which was   trickling down her cheek. “Now it’s over! Now we shall be two together. Now, whatever  happens to me, we will never part. Listen; I am a simple girl, I have not had much education,   though grandmother did get a teacher for me, but truly I understand you, for all that you have   described I have been through myself, when grandmother pinned me to her dress. Of course, I  should not have described it so well as you have; I am not educated,” she added timidly, for   she was still feeling a sort of respect for my pathetic eloquence and lofty style; “but I am very   glad that you have been quite open with me. Now I know you thoroughly, all of you. And do   you know what? I want to tell you my history too, all without concealment, and after that you   must give me advice. You are a very clever man; will you promise to give me advice?”  “Ah, Nastenka,” I cried, “though I have never given advice, still less sensible advice, yet I see  now that if we always go on like this that it will be very sensible, and that each of us will give   the other a great deal of sensible advice! Well, my pretty Nastenka, what sort of advice do   you want? Tell me frankly; at this moment I am so gay and happy, so bold and sensible, that   it won’t be difficult for me to find words.”  “No, no!” Nastenka interrupted, laughing. “I don’t only want sensible advice, I want warm   brotherly advice, as though you had been fond of me all your life!”   “Agreed, Nastenka, agreed!” I cried delighted; “and if I had been fond of you for twenty  years, I couldn’t have been fonder of you than I am now.”   “Your hand,” said Nastenka.  “Here it is,” said I, giving her my hand.  “And so let us begin my history!”   Nastenka’s History  “Half my story you know already—that is, you know that I have an old grandmother....”   “If the other half is as brief as that ...” I interrupted, laughing.   “Be quiet and listen. First of all you must agree not to interrupt me, or else, perhaps I shall get   in a muddle! Come, listen quietly.  14",
    " “I have an old grandmother. I came into her hands when I was quite a little girl, for my father   and mother are dead. It must be supposed that grandmother was once richer, for now she   recalls better days. She taught me French, and then got a teacher for me. When I was fifteen   (and now I am seventeen) we gave up having lessons. It was at that time that I got into   mischief; what I did I won’t tell you; it’s enough to say that it wasn’t very important. But  grandmother called me to her one morning and said that as she was blind she could not look   after me; she took a pin and pinned my dress to hers, and said that we should sit like that for   the rest of our lives if, of course, I did not become a better girl. In fact, at first it was   impossible to get away from her: I had to work, to read and to study all beside grandmother. I   tried to deceive her once, and persuaded Fekla to sit in my place. Fekla is our charwoman,   she is deaf. Fekla sat there instead of me; grandmother was asleep in her armchair at the time,   and I went off to see a friend close by. Well, it ended in trouble. Grandmother woke up while   I was out, and asked some questions; she thought I was still sitting quietly in my place. Fekla   saw that grandmother was asking her something, but could not tell what it was; she wondered   what to do, undid the pin and ran away....”   At this point Nastenka stopped and began laughing. I laughed with her. She left off at once.   “I tell you what, don’t you laugh at grandmother. I laugh because it’s funny.... What can I do,   since grandmother is like that; but yet I am fond of her in a way. Oh, well, I did catch it that   time. I had to sit down in my place at once, and after that I was not allowed to stir.   “Oh, I forgot to tell you that our house belongs to us, that is to grandmother; it is a little   wooden house with three windows as old as grandmother herself, with a little upper storey;   well, there moved into our upper storey a new lodger.”   “Then you had an old lodger,” I observed casually.   “Yes, of course,” answered Nastenka, “and one who knew how to hold his tongue better than  you do. In fact, he hardly ever used his tongue at all. He was a dumb, blind, lame, dried-up   little old man, so that at last he could not go on living, he died; so then we had to find a new   lodger, for we could not live without a lodger—the rent, together with grandmother’s  pension, is almost all we have. But the new lodger, as luck would have it, was a young man, a   stranger not of these parts. As he did not haggle over the rent, grandmother accepted him, and   only afterwards she asked me: ‘Tell me, Nastenka, what is our lodger like—is he young or   old?’ I did not want to lie, so I told grandmother that he wasn’t exactly young and that he   wasn’t old.  “‘And is he pleasant looking?’ asked grandmother.   “Again I did not want to tell a lie: ‘Yes, he is pleasant looking, grandmother,’ I said. And  grandmother said: ‘Oh, what a nuisance, what a nuisance! I tell you this, grandchild, that you   may not be looking after him. What times these are! Why a paltry lodger like this, and he   must be pleasant looking too; it was very different in the old days!’”   “Grandmother was always regretting the old days—she was younger in old days, and the sun   was warmer in old days, and cream did not turn so sour in old days—it was always the old   days! I would sit still and hold my tongue and think to myself: why did grandmother suggest   it to me? Why did she ask whether the lodger was young and good-looking? But that was all,   I just thought it, began counting my stitches again, went on knitting my stocking, and forgot   all about it.  “Well, one morning the lodger came in to see us; he asked about a promise to paper his   rooms. One thing led to another. Grandmother was talkative, and she said: ‘Go, Nastenka,   into my bedroom and bring me my reckoner.’ I jumped up at once; I blushed all over, I don’t  15",
    " know why, and forgot I was sitting pinned to grandmother; instead of quietly undoing the pin,   so that the lodger should not see—I jumped so that grandmother’s chair moved. When I saw  that the lodger knew all about me now, I blushed, stood still as though I had been shot, and   suddenly began to cry—I felt so ashamed and miserable at that minute, that I didn’t know  where to look! Grandmother called out, ‘What are you waiting for?’ and I went on worse than   ever. When the lodger saw, saw that I was ashamed on his account, he bowed and went away   at once!  “After that I felt ready to die at the least sound in the passage. ‘It’s the lodger,’ I kept  thinking; I stealthily undid the pin in case. But it always turned out not to be, he never came.   A fortnight passed; the lodger sent word through Fyokla that he had a great number of French   books, and that they were all good books that I might read, so would not grandmother like me   to read them that I might not be dull? Grandmother agreed with gratitude, but kept asking if   they were moral books, for if the books were immoral it would be out of the question, one   would learn evil from them.”   “‘And what should I learn, grandmother? What is there written in them?’   “‘Ah,’ she said, ‘what’s described in them, is how young men seduce virtuous girls; how, on  the excuse that they want to marry them, they carry them off from their parents’ houses; how   afterwards they leave these unhappy girls to their fate, and they perish in the most pitiful way.   I read a great many books,’ said grandmother, ‘and it is all so well described that one sits up  all night and reads them on the sly. So mind you don’t read them, Nastenka,’ said she. ‘What  books has he sent?’   “‘They are all Walter Scott’s novels, grandmother.’  “‘Walter Scott’s novels! But stay, isn’t there some trick about it? Look, hasn’t he stuck a  love-letter among them?’  “‘No, grandmother,’ I said, ‘there isn’t a love-letter.’  “‘But look under the binding; they sometimes stuff it under the bindings, the rascals!’   “‘No, grandmother, there is nothing under the binding.’   “‘Well, that’s all right.’  “So we began reading Walter Scott, and in a month or so we had read almost half. Then he   sent us more and more. He sent us Pushkin, too; so that at last I could not get on without a   book and left off dreaming of how fine it would be to marry a Chinese Prince.  “That’s how things were when I chanced one day to meet our lodger on the stairs.  Grandmother had sent me to fetch something. He stopped, I blushed and he blushed; he   laughed, though, said good-morning to me, asked after grandmother, and said, ‘Well, have  you read the books?’ I answered that I had. ‘Which did you like best?’ he asked. I said,  ‘Ivanhoe, and Pushkin best of all,’ and so our talk ended for that time.   “A week later I met him again on the stairs. That time grandmother had not sent me, I wanted   to get something for myself. It was past two, and the lodger used to come home at that time.   ‘Good-afternoon,’ said he. I said good-afternoon, too.  “‘Aren’t you dull,’ he said, ‘sitting all day with your grandmother?’  “When he asked that, I blushed, I don’t know why; I felt ashamed, and again I felt   offended—I suppose because other people had begun to ask me about that. I wanted to go   away without answering, but I hadn’t the strength.  16",
    " “‘Listen,’ he said, ‘you are a good girl. Excuse my speaking to you like that, but I assure you  that I wish for your welfare quite as much as your grandmother. Have you no friends that you   could go and visit?’   “I told him I hadn’t any, that I had had no friend but Mashenka, and she had gone away to   Pskov.   “‘Listen,’ he said, ‘would you like to go to the theatre with me?’  “‘To the theatre. What about grandmother?’   “‘But you must go without your grandmother’s knowing it,’ he said.  “‘No,’ I said, ‘I don’t want to deceive grandmother. Good-bye.’  “‘Well, good-bye,’ he answered, and said nothing more.  “Only after dinner he came to see us; sat a long time talking to grandmother; asked her   whether she ever went out anywhere, whether she had acquaintances, and suddenly said: ‘I  have taken a box at the opera for this evening; they are giving  The Barber of Seville . My  friends meant to go, but afterwards refused, so the ticket is left on my hands.’ ‘ The Barber of  Seville ,’ cried grandmother; ‘why, the same they used to act in old days?’  “‘Yes, it’s the same barber,’ he said, and glanced at me. I saw what it meant and turned  crimson, and my heart began throbbing with suspense.   “‘To be sure, I know it,’ said grandmother; ‘why, I took the part of Rosina myself in old days,   at a private performance!’  “‘So wouldn’t you like to go to-day?’ said the lodger. ‘Or my ticket will be wasted.’  “‘By all means let us go,’ said grandmother; why shouldn’t we? And my Nastenka here has  never been to the theatre.’  “My goodness, what joy! We got ready at once, put on our best clothes, and set off. Though   grandmother was blind, still she wanted to hear the music; besides, she is a kind old soul,   what she cared most for was to amuse me, we should never have gone of ourselves.  “What my impressions of  The Barber of Seville  were I won’t tell you; but all that evening our  lodger looked at me so nicely, talked so nicely, that I saw at once that he had meant to test me   in the morning when he proposed that I should go with him alone. Well, it was joy! I went to   bed so proud, so gay, my heart beat so that I was a little feverish, and all night I was raving   about  The Barber of Seville .  “I expected that he would come and see us more and more often after that, but it wasn’t so at  all. He almost entirely gave up coming. He would just come in about once a month, and then   only to invite us to the theatre. We went twice again. Only I wasn’t at all pleased with that; I  saw that he was simply sorry for me because I was so hardly treated by grandmother, and that   was all. As time went on, I grew more and more restless, I couldn’t sit still, I couldn’t read, I  couldn’t work; sometimes I laughed and did something to annoy grandmother, at another   time I would cry. At last I grew thin and was very nearly ill. The opera season was over, and   our lodger had quite given up coming to see us; whenever we met—always on the same   staircase, of course—he would bow so silently, so gravely, as though he did not want to   speak, and go down to the front door, while I went on standing in the middle of the stairs, as   red as a cherry, for all the blood rushed to my head at the sight of him.   “Now the end is near. Just a year ago, in May, the lodger came to us and said to grandmother   that he had finished his business here, and that he must go back to Moscow for a year. When  17",
    " I heard that, I sank into a chair half dead; grandmother did not notice anything; and having   informed us that he should be leaving us, he bowed and went away.   “What was I to do? I thought and thought and fretted and fretted, and at last I made up my   mind. Next day he was to go away, and I made up my mind to end it all that evening when   grandmother went to bed. And so it happened. I made up all my clothes in a parcel—all the  linen I needed—and with the parcel in my hand, more dead than alive, went upstairs to our  lodger. I believe I must have stayed an hour on the staircase. When I opened his door he cried   out as he looked at me. He thought I was a ghost, and rushed to give me some water, for I   could hardly stand up. My heart beat so violently that my head ached, and I did not know   what I was doing. When I recovered I began by laying my parcel on his bed, sat down beside   it, hid my face in my hands and went into floods of tears. I think he understood it all at once,   and looked at me so sadly that my heart was torn.   “‘Listen,’ he began, ‘listen, Nastenka, I can’t do anything; I am a poor man, for I have  nothing, not even a decent berth. How could we live, if I were to marry you?’   “We talked a long time; but at last I got quite frantic, I said I could not go on living with   grandmother, that I should run away from her, that I did not want to be pinned to her, and that   I would go to Moscow if he liked, because I could not live without him. Shame and pride and   love were all clamouring in me at once, and I fell on the bed almost in convulsions, I was so   afraid of a refusal.  “He sat for some minutes in silence, then got up, came up to me and took me by the hand.   “‘Listen, my dear good Nastenka, listen; I swear to you that if I am ever in a position to   marry, you shall make my happiness. I assure you that now you are the only one who could   make me happy. Listen, I am going to Moscow and shall be there just a year; I hope to   establish my position. When I come back, if you still love me, I swear that we will be happy.   Now it is impossible, I am not able, I have not the right to promise anything. Well, I repeat, if   it is not within a year it will certainly be some time; that is, of course, if you do not prefer any   one else, for I cannot and dare not bind you by any sort of promise.’   “That was what he said to me, and next day he went away. We agreed together not to say a   word to grandmother: that was his wish. Well, my history is nearly finished now. Just a year   has past. He has arrived; he has been here three days, and, and  “And what?” I cried, impatient to hear the end.   “And up to now has not shown himself!” answered Nastenka, as though screwing up all her   courage. “There’s no sign or sound of him.”  Here she stopped, paused for a minute, bent her head, and covering her face with her hands   broke into such sobs that it sent a pang to my heart to hear them. I had not in the least   expected such a  dénouement .  “Nastenka,” I began timidly in an ingratiating voice, “Nastenka! For goodness’ sake don’t  cry! How do you know? Perhaps he is not here yet....”   “He is, he is,” Nastenka repeated. “He is here, and I know it. We  made an agreement  at the  time, that evening, before he went away: when we said all that I have told you, and had come   to an understanding, then we came out here for a walk on this embankment. It was ten   o’clock; we sat on this seat. I was not crying then; it was sweet to me to hear what he said....   And he said that he would come to us directly he arrived, and if I did not refuse him, then we   would tell grandmother about it all. Now he is here, I know it, and yet he does not come!”   And again she burst into tears.  18",
    " “Good God, can I do nothing to help you in your sorrow?” I cried jumping up from the seat in   utter despair. “Tell me, Nastenka, wouldn’t it be possible for me to go to him?”  “Would that be possible?” she asked suddenly, raising her head.   “No, of course not,” I said pulling myself up; “but I tell you what, write a letter.”  “No, that’s impossible, I can’t do that,” she answered with decision, bending her head and not   looking at me.   “How impossible—why is it impossible?” I went on, clinging to my idea. “But, Nastenka, it  depends what sort of letter; there are letters and letters and.... Ah, Nastenka, I am right; trust   to me, trust to me, I will not give you bad advice. It can all be arranged! You took the first   step—why not now?”  “I can’t. I can’t! It would seem as though I were forcing myself on him....”  “Ah, my good little Nastenka,” I said, hardly able to conceal a smile; “no, no, you have a  right to, in fact, because he made you a promise. Besides, I can see from everything that he is   a man of delicate feeling; that he behaved very well,” I went on, more and more carried away  by the logic of my own arguments and convictions. “How did he behave? He bound himself   by a promise: he said that if he married at all he would marry no one but you; he gave you   full liberty to refuse him at once.... Under such circumstances you may take the first step; you   have the right; you are in the privileged position—if, for instance, you wanted to free him   from his promise....”   “Listen; how would you write?”   “Write what?”  “This letter.”  “I tell you how I would write: ‘Dear Sir.’...”  “Must I really begin like that, ‘Dear Sir’?”  “You certainly must! Though, after all, I don’t know, I imagine....”   “Well, well, what next?”  “‘Dear Sir,—I must apologize for——’ But, no, there’s no need to apologize; the fact itself  justifies everything. Write simply:—   “‘I am writing to you. Forgive me my impatience; but I have been happy for a whole year in   hope; am I to blame for being unable to endure a day of doubt now? Now that you have   come, perhaps you have changed your mind. If so, this letter is to tell you that I do not repine,   nor blame you. I do not blame you because I have no power over your heart, such is my fate!   “‘You are an honourable man. You will not smile or be vexed at these impatient lines.   Remember they are written by a poor girl; that she is alone; that she has no one to direct her,   no one to advise her, and that she herself could never control her heart. But forgive me that a   doubt has stolen—if only for one instant—into my heart. You are not capable of insulting,   even in thought, her who so loved and so loves you.’”   “Yes, yes; that’s exactly what I was thinking!” cried Nastenka, and her eyes beamed with  delight. “Oh, you have solved my difficulties: God has sent you to me! Thank you, thank   you!”   “What for? What for? For God’s sending me?” I answered, looking delighted at her joyful  little face. “Why, yes; for that too.”  19",
    " “Ah, Nastenka! Why, one thanks some people for being alive at the same time with one; I   thank you for having met me, for my being able to remember you all my life!”   “Well, enough, enough! But now I tell you what, listen: we made an agreement then that as   soon as he arrived he would let me know, by leaving a letter with some good simple people   of my acquaintance who know nothing about it; or, if it were impossible to write a letter to  me, for a letter does not always tell everything, he would be here at ten o’clock on the day he   arrived, where we had arranged to meet. I know he has arrived already; but now it’s the third   day, and there’s no sign of him and no letter. It’s impossible for me to get away from   grandmother in the morning. Give my letter to-morrow to those kind people I spoke to you   about: they will send it on to him, and if there is an answer you bring it to-morrow at ten   o’clock.”  “But the letter, the letter! You see, you must write the letter first! So perhaps it must all be the  day after to-morrow.”  “The letter ...” said Nastenka, a little confused, “the letter ... but....”  But she did not finish. At first she turned her little face away from me, flushed like a rose,   and suddenly I felt in my hand a letter which had evidently been written long before, all ready   and sealed up. A familiar sweet and charming reminiscence floated through my mind.  “R, o—Ro; s, i—si; n, a—na,” I began.  “Rosina!” we both hummed together; I almost embracing her with delight, while she blushed   as only she could blush, and laughed through the tears which gleamed like pearls on her black   eyelashes.  “Come, enough, enough! Good-bye now,” she said speaking rapidly. “Here is the letter, here  is the address to which you are to take it. Good-bye, till we meet again! Till to-morrow!”  She pressed both my hands warmly, nodded her head, and flew like an arrow down her side   street. I stood still for a long time following her with my eyes.  “Till to-morrow! till to-morrow!” was ringing in my ears as she vanished from my sight.  THIRD NIGHT  To-day was a gloomy, rainy day without a glimmer of sunlight, like the old age before me. I  am oppressed by such strange thoughts, such gloomy sensations; questions still so obscure to   me are crowding into my brain—and I seem to have neither power nor will to settle them. It’s  not for me to settle all this!  To-day we shall not meet. Yesterday, when we said good-bye, the clouds began gathering  over the sky and a mist rose. I said that to-morrow it would be a bad day; she made no   answer, she did not want to speak against her wishes; for her that day was bright and clear,   not one cloud should obscure her happiness.   “If it rains we shall not see each other,” she said, “I shall not come.”  I thought that she would not notice to-day’s rain, and yet she has not come.  Yesterday was our third interview, our third white night....   But how fine joy and happiness makes any one! How brimming over with love the heart is!   One seems longing to pour out one’s whole heart; one wants everything to be gay, everything   to be laughing. And how infectious that joy is! There was such a softness in her words, such a   kindly feeling in her heart towards me yesterday.... How solicitous and friendly she was; how  20",
    " tenderly she tried to give me courage! Oh, the coquetry of happiness! While I ... I took it all   for the genuine thing, I thought that she....   But, my God, how could I have thought it? How could I have been so blind, when everything   had been taken by another already, when nothing was mine; when, in fact, her very   tenderness to me, her anxiety, her love ... yes, love for me, was nothing else but joy at the   thought of seeing another man so soon, desire to include me, too, in her happiness?... When   he did not come, when we waited in vain, she frowned, she grew timid and discouraged. Her   movements, her words, were no longer so light, so playful, so gay; and, strange to say, she   redoubled her attentiveness to me, as though instinctively desiring to lavish on me what she   desired for herself so anxiously, if her wishes were not accomplished. My Nastenka was so   downcast, so dismayed, that I think she realized at last that I loved her, and was sorry for my   poor love. So when we are unhappy we feel the unhappiness of others more; feeling is not   destroyed but concentrated....   I went to meet her with a full heart, and was all impatience. I had no presentiment that I   should feel as I do now, that it would not all end happily. She was beaming with pleasure; she   was expecting an answer. The answer was himself. He was to come, to run at her call. She   arrived a whole hour before I did. At first she giggled at everything, laughed at every word I   said. I began talking, but relapsed into silence.   “Do you know why I am so glad,” she said, “so glad to look at you?—why I like you so much   to-day?”  “Well?” I asked, and my heart began throbbing.  “I like you because you have not fallen in love with me. You know that some men in your   place would have been pestering and worrying me, would have been sighing and miserable,   while you are so nice!”   Then she wrung my hand so hard that I almost cried out. She laughed.   “Goodness, what a friend you are!” she began gravely a minute later. “God sent you to me.   What would have happened to me if you had not been with me now? How disinterested you   are! How truly you care for me! When I am married we will be great friends, more than   brother and sister; I shall care almost as I do for him....”   I felt horribly sad at that moment, yet something like laughter was stirring in my soul.   “You are very much upset,” I said; “you are frightened; you think he won’t come.”  “Oh dear!” she answered; “if I were less happy, I believe I should cry at your lack of faith, at   your reproaches. However, you have made me think and have given me a lot to think about;   but I shall think later, and now I will own that you are right. Yes, I am somehow not myself; I   am all suspense, and feel everything as it were too lightly. But hush! that’s enough about   feelings....”   At that moment we heard footsteps, and in the darkness we saw a figure coming towards us.   We both started; she almost cried out; I dropped her hand and made a movement as though to   walk away. But we were mistaken, it was not he.  “What are you afraid of? Why did you let go of my hand?” she said, giving it to me again.   “Come, what is it? We will meet him together; I want him to see how fond we are of each  other.”   “How fond we are of each other!” I cried. (“Oh, Nastenka, Nastenka,” I thought, “how much  you have told me in that saying! Such fondness at  certain  moments makes the heart cold and  21",
    " the soul heavy. Your hand is cold, mine burns like fire. How blind you are, Nastenka!... Oh,   how unbearable a happy person is sometimes! But I could not be angry with you!”)   At last my heart was too full.  “Listen, Nastenka!” I cried. “Do you know how it has been with me all day.”  “Why, how, how? Tell me quickly! Why have you said nothing all this time?”   “To begin with, Nastenka, when I had carried out all your commissions, given the letter, gone   to see your good friends, then ... then I went home and went to bed.”   “Is that all?” she interrupted, laughing.  “Yes, almost all,” I answered restraining myself, for foolish tears were already starting into  my eyes. “I woke an hour before our appointment, and yet, as it were, I had not been asleep. I   don’t know what happened to me. I came to tell you all about it, feeling as though time were   standing still, feeling as though one sensation, one feeling must remain with me from that   time for ever; feeling as though one minute must go on for all eternity, and as though all life   had come to a standstill for me.... When I woke up it seemed as though some musical motive   long familiar, heard somewhere in the past, forgotten and voluptuously sweet, had come back   to me now. It seemed to me that it had been clamouring at my heart all my life, and only   now....”   “Oh my goodness, my goodness,” Nastenka interrupted, “what does all that mean? I don’t  understand a word.”   “Ah, Nastenka, I wanted somehow to convey to you that strange impression....” I began in a   plaintive voice, in which there still lay hid a hope, though a very faint one.   “Leave off. Hush!” she said, and in one instant the sly puss had guessed.  Suddenly she became extraordinarily talkative, gay, mischievous; she took my arm, laughed,   wanted me to laugh too, and every confused word I uttered evoked from her prolonged   ringing laughter.... I began to feel angry, she had suddenly begun flirting.   “Do you know,” she began, “I feel a little vexed that you are not in love with me? There’s no   understanding human nature! But all the same, Mr. Unapproachable, you cannot blame me   for being so simple; I tell you everything, everything, whatever foolish thought comes into   my head.”   “Listen! That’s eleven, I believe,” I said as the slow chime of a bell rang out from a distant  tower. She suddenly stopped, left off laughing and began to count.   “Yes, it’s eleven,” she said at last in a timid, uncertain voice.  I regretted at once that I had frightened her, making her count the strokes, and I cursed myself   for my spiteful impulse; I felt sorry for her, and did not know how to atone for what I had   done.   I began comforting her, seeking for reasons for his not coming, advancing various arguments,   proofs. No one could have been easier to deceive than she was at that moment; and, indeed,   any one at such a moment listens gladly to any consolation, whatever it may be, and is   overjoyed if a shadow of excuse can be found.   “And indeed it’s an absurd thing,” I began, warming to my task and admiring the   extraordinary clearness of my argument, “why, he could not have come; you have muddled   and confused me, Nastenka, so that I too, have lost count of the time.... Only think: he can   scarcely have received the letter; suppose he is not able to come, suppose he is going to  22",
    " answer the letter, could not come before to-morrow. I will go for it as soon as it’s light to- morrow and let you know at once. Consider, there are thousands of possibilities; perhaps he   was not at home when the letter came, and may not have read it even now! Anything may   happen, you know.”   “Yes, yes!” said Nastenka. “I did not think of that. Of course anything may happen?” she  went on in a tone that offered no opposition, though some other far-away thought could be   heard like a vexatious discord in it. “I tell you what you must do,” she said, “you go as early   as possible to-morrow morning, and if you get anything let me know at once. You know   where I live, don’t you?”   And she began repeating her address to me.   Then she suddenly became so tender, so solicitous with me. She seemed to listen attentively   to what I told her; but when I asked her some question she was silent, was confused, and   turned her head away. I looked into her eyes—yes, she was crying.   “How can you? How can you? Oh, what a baby you are! what childishness!... Come, come!”   She tried to smile, to calm herself, but her chin was quivering and her bosom was still   heaving.   “I was thinking about you,” she said after a minute’s silence. “You are so kind that I should  be a stone if I did not feel it. Do you know what has occurred to me now? I was comparing   you two. Why isn’t he you? Why isn’t he like you? He is not as good as you, though I love   him more than you.”   I made no answer. She seemed to expect me to say something.   “Of course, it may be that I don’t understand him fully yet. You know I was always as it were   afraid of him; he was always so grave, as it were so proud. Of course I know it’s only that he   seems like that, I know there is more tenderness in his heart than in mine.... I remember how   he looked at me when I went in to him—do you remember?—with my bundle; but yet I   respect him too much, and doesn’t that show that we are not equals?”   “No, Nastenka, no,” I answered, “it shows that you love him more than anything in the world,  and far more than yourself.”   “Yes, supposing that is so,” answered Nastenka naïvely. “But do you know what strikes me   now? Only I am not talking about him now, but speaking generally; all this came into my   mind some time ago. Tell me, how is it that we can’t all be like brothers together? Why is it  that even the best of men always seem to hide something from other people and to keep   something back? Why not say straight out what is in one’s heart, when one knows that one is   not speaking idly? As it is every one seems harsher than he really is, as though all were afraid   of doing injustice to their feelings, by being too quick to express them.”   “Oh, Nastenka, what you say is true; but there are many reasons for that,” I broke in   suppressing my own feelings at that moment more than ever.   “No, no!” she answered with deep feeling. “Here you, for instance, are not like other people!   I really don’t know how to tell you what I feel; but it seems to me that you, for instance ... at   the present moment ... it seems to me that you are sacrificing something for me,” she added   timidly, with a fleeting glance at me. “Forgive me for saying so, I am a simple girl you know.   I have seen very little of life, and I really sometimes don’t know how to say things,” she   added in a voice that quivered with some hidden feeling, while she tried to smile; “but I only   wanted to tell you that I am grateful, that I feel it all too.... Oh, may God give you happiness   for it! What you told me about your dreamer is quite untrue now—that is, I mean, it’s not true  23",
    " of you. You are recovering, you are quite a different man from what you described. If you   ever fall in love with some one, God give you happiness with her! I won’t wish anything for   her, for she will be happy with you. I know, I am a woman myself, so you must believe me   when I tell you so.”   She ceased speaking, and pressed my hand warmly. I too could not speak without emotion.   Some minutes passed.   “Yes, it’s clear he won’t come to-night,” she said at last raising her head. “It’s late.”  “He will come to-morrow,” I said in the most firm and convincing tone.  “Yes,” she added with no sign of her former depression. “I see for myself now that he could  not come till to-morrow. Well, good-bye, till to-morrow. If it rains perhaps I shall not come.  But the day after to-morrow, I shall come. I shall come for certain, whatever happens; be sure  to be here, I want to see you, I will tell you everything.”   And then when we parted she gave me her hand and said, looking at me candidly: “We shall  always be together, shan’t we?”  Oh, Nastenka, Nastenka! If only you knew how lonely I am now!   As soon as it struck nine o’clock I could not stay indoors, but put on my things, and went out   in spite of the weather. I was there, sitting on our seat. I went to her street, but I felt ashamed,   and turned back without looking at their windows, when I was two steps from her door. I   went home more depressed than I had ever been before. What a damp, dreary day! If it had   been fine I should have walked about all night....   But to-morrow, to-morrow! To-morrow she will tell me everything. The letter has not come  to-day, however. But that was to be expected. They are together by now....  FOURTH NIGHT  My God, how it has all ended! What it has all ended in! I arrived at nine o’clock. She was  already there. I noticed her a good way off; she was standing as she had been that first time,   with her elbows on the railing, and she did not hear me coming up to her.   “Nastenka!” I called to her, suppressing my agitation with an effort.  She turned to me quickly.   “Well?” she said. “Well? Make haste!”  I looked at her in perplexity.   “Well, where is the letter? Have you brought the letter?” she repeated clutching at the railing.  “No, there is no letter,” I said at last. “Hasn’t he been to you yet?” She turned fearfully pale  and looked at me for a long time without moving. I had shattered her last hope.   “Well, God be with him,” she said at last in a breaking voice; “God be with him if he leaves   me like that.”  She dropped her eyes, then tried to look at me and could not. For several minutes she was   struggling with her emotion. All at once she turned away, leaning her elbows against the   railing and burst into tears.   “Oh don’t, don’t!” I began; but looking at her I had not the heart to go on, and what was I to  say to her?  24",
    " “Don’t try and comfort me,” she said; “don’t talk about him; don’t tell me that he will come,  that he has not cast me off so cruelly and so inhumanly as he has. What for—what for? Can   there have been something in my letter, that unlucky letter?”   At that point sobs stifled her voice; my heart was torn as I looked at her.   “Oh, how inhumanly cruel it is!” she began again. “And not a line, not a line! He might at   least have written that he does not want me, that he rejects me—but not a line for three days!  How easy it is for him to wound, to insult a poor, defenceless girl, whose only fault is that she   loves him! Oh, what I’ve suffered during these three days! Oh, dear! When I think that I was   the first to go to him, that I humbled myself before him, cried, that I begged of him a little   love!... and after that! Listen,” she said, turning to me, and her black eyes flashed, “it isn’t so!  It can’t be so; it isn’t natural. Either you are mistaken or I; perhaps he has not received the  letter? Perhaps he still knows nothing about it? How could any one—judge for yourself, tell   me, for goodness’ sake explain it to me, I can’t understand it—how could any one behave   with such barbarous coarseness as he has behaved to me? Not one word! Why, the lowest   creature on earth is treated more compassionately. Perhaps he has heard something, perhaps   some one has told him something about me,” she cried, turning to me inquiringly: “What do  you think?”   “Listen, Nastenka, I shall go to him to-morrow in your name.”   “Yes?”  “I will question him about everything; I will tell him everything.”  “Yes, yes?”  “You write a letter. Don’t say no, Nastenka, don’t say no! I will make him respect your  action, he shall hear all about it, and if——”   “No, my friend, no,” she interrupted. “Enough! Not another word, not another line from  me—enough! I don’t know him; I don’t love him any more. I will ... forget him.”  She could not go on.   “Calm yourself, calm yourself! Sit here, Nastenka,” I said, making her sit down on the seat.   “I am calm. Don’t trouble. It’s nothing! It’s only tears, they will soon dry. Why, do you  imagine I shall do away with myself, that I shall throw myself into the river?”  My heart was full: I tried to speak, but I could not.   “Listen,” she said taking my hand. “Tell me: you wouldn’t have behaved like this, would  you? You would not have abandoned a girl who had come to you of herself, you would not   have thrown into her face a shameless taunt at her weak foolish heart? You would have taken   care of her? You would have realized that she was alone, that she did not know how to look   after herself, that she could not guard herself from loving you, that it was not her fault, not   her fault—that she had done nothing.... Oh dear, oh dear!”  “Nastenka!” I cried at last, unable to control my emotion. “Nastenka, you torture me! You  wound my heart, you are killing me, Nastenka! I cannot be silent! I must speak at last, give   utterance to what is surging in my heart!”   As I said this I got up from the seat. She took my hand and looked at me in surprise.   “What is the matter with you?” she said at last.  25",
    " “Listen,” I said resolutely. “Listen to me, Nastenka! What I am going to say to you now is all  nonsense, all impossible, all stupid! I know that this can never be, but I cannot be silent. For   the sake of what you are suffering now, I beg you beforehand to forgive me!”   “What is it? What is it?” she said drying her tears and looking at me intently, while a strange  curiosity gleamed in her astonished eyes. “What is the matter?”  “It’s impossible, but I love you, Nastenka! There it is! Now everything is told,” I said with a  wave of my hand. “Now you will see whether you can go on talking to me as you did just   now, whether you can listen to what I am going to say to you.”...   “Well, what then?” Nastenka interrupted me. “What of it? I knew you loved me long ago,  only I always thought that you simply liked me very much.... Oh dear, oh dear!”   “At first it was simply liking, Nastenka, but now, now! I am just in the same position as you   were when you went to him with your bundle. In a worse position than you, Nastenka,   because he cared for no one else as you do.”   “What are you saying to me! I don’t understand you in the least. But tell me, what’s this for; I  don’t mean what for, but why are you ... so suddenly.... Oh dear, I am talking nonsense! But   you....”   And Nastenka broke off in confusion. Her cheeks flamed; she dropped her eyes.   “What’s to be done, Nastenka, what am I to do? I am to blame. I have abused your.... But no,  no, I am not to blame, Nastenka; I feel that, I know that, because my heart tells me I am right,   for I cannot hurt you in any way, I cannot wound you! I was your friend, but I am still your   friend, I have betrayed no trust. Here my tears are falling, Nastenka. Let them flow, let them   flow—they don’t hurt anybody. They will dry, Nastenka.”  “Sit down, sit down,” she said, making me sit down on the seat. “Oh, my God!”   “No, Nastenka, I won’t sit down; I cannot stay here any longer, you cannot see me again; I   will tell you everything and go away. I only want to say that you would never have found out   that I loved you. I should have kept my secret. I would not have worried you at such a   moment with my egoism. No! But I could not resist it now; you spoke of it yourself, it is your   fault, your fault and not mine. You cannot drive me away from you.”...   “No, no, I don’t drive you away, no!” said Nastenka, concealing her confusion as best she   could, poor child.   “You don’t drive me away? No! But I meant to run from you myself. I will go away, but first   I will tell you all, for when you were crying here I could not sit unmoved, when you wept,   when you were in torture at being—at being—I will speak of it, Nastenka—at being forsaken,  at your love being repulsed, I felt that in my heart there was so much love for you, Nastenka,   so much love! And it seemed so bitter that I could not help you with my love, that my heart   was breaking and I ... I could not be silent, I had to speak, Nastenka, I had to speak!”   “Yes, yes! tell me, talk to me,” said Nastenka with an indescribable gesture. “Perhaps you  think it strange that I talk to you like this, but ... speak! I will tell you afterwards! I will tell   you everything.”   “You are sorry for me, Nastenka, you are simply sorry for me, my dear little friend! What’s  done can’t be mended. What is said cannot be taken back. Isn’t that so? Well, now you know.  That’s the starting-point. Very well. Now it’s all right, only listen. When you were sitting  crying I thought to myself (oh, let me tell you what I was thinking!), I thought, that (of course   it cannot be, Nastenka), I thought that you ... I thought that you somehow ... quite apart from  26",
    " me, had ceased to love him. Then—I thought that yesterday and the day before yesterday,   Nastenka—then I would—I certainly would—have succeeded in making you love me; you   know, you said yourself, Nastenka, that you almost loved me. Well, what next? Well, that’s  nearly all I wanted to tell you; all that is left to say is how it would be if you loved me, only   that, nothing more! Listen, my friend—for any way you are my friend—I am, of course, a   poor, humble man, of no great consequence; but that’s not the point (I don’t seem to be able  to say what I mean, Nastenka, I am so confused), only I would love you, I would love you so,   that even if you still loved him, even if you went on loving the man I don’t know, you would   never feel that my love was a burden to you. You would only feel every minute that at your   side was beating a grateful, grateful heart, a warm heart ready for your sake.... Oh Nastenka,   Nastenka! What have you done to me?”   “Don’t cry; I don’t want you to cry,” said Nastenka getting up quickly from the seat. “Come  along, get up, come with me, don’t cry, don’t cry,” she said, drying her tears with her  handkerchief; “let us go now; maybe I will tell you something.... If he has forsaken me now,   if he has forgotten me, though I still love him (I do not want to deceive you) ... but listen,   answer me. If I were to love you, for instance, that is, if I only.... Oh my friend, my friend! To   think, to think how I wounded you, when I laughed at your love, when I praised you for not   falling in love with me. Oh dear! How was it I did not foresee this, how was it I did not   foresee this, how could I have been so stupid? But.... Well, I have made up my mind, I will   tell you.”   “Look here, Nastenka, do you know what? I’ll go away, that’s what I’ll do. I am simply  tormenting you. Here you are remorseful for having laughed at me, and I won’t have you ...   in addition to your sorrow.... Of course it is my fault, Nastenka, but good-bye!”  “Stay, listen to me: can you wait?”  “What for? How?”  “I love him; but I shall get over it, I must get over it, I cannot fail to get over it; I am getting  over it, I feel that.... Who knows? Perhaps it will all end to-day, for I hate him, for he has   been laughing at me, while you have been weeping here with me, for you have not repulsed   me as he has, for you love me while he has never loved me, for in fact, I love you myself....   Yes, I love you! I love you as you love me; I have told you so before, you heard it yourself—  I love you because you are better than he is, because you are nobler than he is, because,   because he——”   The poor girl’s emotion was so violent that she could not say more; she laid her head upon   my shoulder, then upon my bosom, and wept bitterly. I comforted her, I persuaded her, but   she could not stop crying; she kept pressing my hand, and saying between her sobs: “Wait,  wait, it will be over in a minute! I want to tell you ... you mustn’t think that these tears—it’s  nothing, it’s weakness, wait till it’s over.”... At last she left off crying, dried her eyes and we  walked on again. I wanted to speak, but she still begged me to wait. We were silent.... At last   she plucked up courage and began to speak.   “It’s like this,” she began in a weak and quivering voice, in which, however, there was a note  that pierced my heart with a sweet pang; “don’t think that I am so light and inconstant, don’t  think that I can forget and change so quickly. I have loved him for a whole year, and I swear   by God that I have never, never, even in thought, been unfaithful to him.... He has despised   me, he has been laughing at me—God forgive him! But he has insulted me and wounded my   heart. I ... I do not love him, for I can only love what is magnanimous, what understands me,   what is generous; for I am like that myself and he is not worthy of me—well, that’s enough   of him. He has done better than if he had deceived my expectations later, and shown me later  27",
    " what he was.... Well, it’s over! But who knows, my dear friend,” she went on pressing my   hand, “who knows, perhaps my whole love was a mistaken feeling, a delusion—perhaps it   began in mischief, in nonsense, because I was kept so strictly by grandmother? Perhaps I   ought to love another man, not him, a different man, who would have pity on me and ...   and.... But don’t let us say any more about that,” Nastenka broke off, breathless with emotion,   “I only wanted to tell you ... I wanted to tell you that if, although I love him (no, did love   him), if, in spite of this you still say.... If you feel that your love is so great that it may at last   drive from my heart my old feeling—if you will have pity on me—if you do not want to   leave me alone to my fate, without hope, without consolation—if you are ready to love me   always as you do now—I swear to you that gratitude ... that my love will be at last worthy of   your love.... Will you take my hand?”   “Nastenka!” I cried breathless with sobs. “Nastenka, oh Nastenka!”  “Enough, enough! Well, now it’s quite enough,” she said, hardly able to control herself.   “Well, now all has been said, hasn’t it! Hasn’t it? You are happy—I am happy too. Not  another word about it, wait; spare me ... talk of something else, for God’s sake.”  “Yes, Nastenka, yes! Enough about that, now I am happy. I—— Yes, Nastenka, yes, let us   talk of other things, let us make haste and talk. Yes! I am ready.”   And we did not know what to say: we laughed, we wept, we said thousands of things   meaningless and incoherent; at one moment we walked along the pavement, then suddenly   turned back and crossed the road; then we stopped and went back again to the embankment;   we were like children.  “I am living alone now, Nastenka,” I began, “but to-morrow! Of course you know, Nastenka,  I am poor, I have only got twelve hundred roubles, but that doesn’t matter.”  “Of course not, and granny has her pension, so she will be no burden. We must take granny.”   “Of course we must take granny. But there’s Matrona.”  “Yes, and we’ve got Fyokla too!”   “Matrona is a good woman, but she has one fault: she has no imagination, Nastenka,   absolutely none; but that doesn’t matter.”  “That’s all right—they can live together; only you must move to us to-morrow.”  “To you? How so? All right, I am ready.”   “Yes, hire a room from us. We have a top floor, it’s empty. We had an old lady lodging there,   but she has gone away; and I know granny would like to have a young man. I said to her,   ‘Why a young man?’ And she said, ‘Oh, because I am old; only don’t you fancy, Nastenka,   that I want him as a husband for you.’ So I guessed it was with that idea.”  “Oh, Nastenka!”  And we both laughed.   “Come, that’s enough, that’s enough. But where do you live? I’ve forgotten.”  “Over that way, near X bridge, Barannikov’s Buildings.”   “It’s that big house?”  “Yes, that big house.”   “Oh, I know, a nice house; only you know you had better give it up and come to us as soon as   possible.”  28",
    " “To-morrow, Nastenka, to-morrow; I owe a little for my rent there but that doesn’t matter. I  shall soon get my salary.”   “And do you know I will perhaps give lessons; I will learn something myself and then give   lessons.”  “Capital! And I shall soon get a bonus.”   “So by to-morrow you will be my lodger.”   “And we will go to  The Barber of Seville , for they are soon going to give it again.”  “Yes, we’ll go,” said Nastenka, “but better see something else and not  The Barber of Seville .”  “Very well, something else. Of course that will be better, I did not think——”   As we talked like this we walked along in a sort of delirium, a sort of intoxication, as though   we did not know what was happening to us. At one moment we stopped and talked for a long   time at the same place; then we went on again, and goodness knows where we went; and  again tears and again laughter. All of a sudden Nastenka would want to go home, and I would   not dare to detain her but would want to see her to the house; we set off, and in a quarter of   an hour found ourselves at the embankment by our seat. Then she would sigh, and tears   would come into her eyes again; I would turn chill with dismay.... But she would press my   hand and force me to walk, to talk, to chatter as before.   “It’s time I was home at last; I think it must be very late,” Nastenka said at last. “We must  give over being childish.”   “Yes, Nastenka, only I shan’t sleep to-night; I am not going home.”  “I don’t think I shall sleep either; only see me home.”  “I should think so!”   “Only this time we really must get to the house.”  “We must, we must.”  “Honour bright? For you know one must go home some time!”   “Honour bright,” I answered laughing.   “Well, come along!”  “Come along! Look at the sky, Nastenka. Look! To-morrow it will be a lovely day; what a  blue sky, what a moon! Look; that yellow cloud is covering it now, look, look! No, it has   passed by. Look, look!”   But Nastenka did not look at the cloud; she stood mute as though turned to stone; a minute   later she huddled timidly close up to me. Her hand trembled in my hand; I looked at her. She   pressed still more closely to me.  At that moment a young man passed by us. He suddenly stopped, looked at us intently, and   then again took a few steps on. My heart began throbbing.   “Who is it, Nastenka?” I said in an undertone.   “It’s he,” she answered in a whisper, huddling up to me, still more closely, still more  tremulously.... I could hardly stand on my feet.   “Nastenka, Nastenka! It’s you!” I heard a voice behind us and at the same moment the young  man took several steps towards us.  29",
    " My God, how she cried out! How she started! How she tore herself out of my arms and   rushed to meet him! I stood and looked at them, utterly crushed. But she had hardly given   him her hand, had hardly flung herself into his arms, when she turned to me again, was beside   me again in a flash, and before I knew where I was she threw both arms round my neck and   gave me a warm, tender kiss. Then, without saying a word to me, she rushed back to him   again, took his hand, and drew him after her.   I stood a long time looking after them. At last the two vanished from my sight.   MORNING  My night ended with the morning. It was a wet day. The rain was falling and beating   disconsolately upon my window pane; it was dark in the room and grey outside. My head   ached and I was giddy; fever was stealing over my limbs.   “There’s a letter for you, sir; the postman brought it,” Matrona said stooping over me.  “A letter? From whom?” I cried jumping up from my chair.  “I don’t know, sir, better look—maybe it is written there whom it is from.”  I broke the seal. It was from her!   * * * * *   “Oh, forgive me, forgive me! I beg you on my knees to forgive me! I deceived you and   myself. It was a dream, a mirage.... My heart aches for you to-day; forgive me, forgive me!   “Don’t blame me, for I have not changed to you in the least. I told you that I would love you,  I love you now, I more than love you. Oh, my God! If only I could love you both at once! Oh,   if only you were he!”   [“Oh, if only he were you,” echoed in my mind. I remembered your words, Nastenka!]   “God knows what I would do for you now! I know that you are sad and dreary. I have   wounded you, but you know when one loves a wrong is soon forgotten. And you love me.   “Thank you, yes, thank you for that love! For it will live in my memory like a sweet dream   which lingers long after awakening; for I shall remember for ever that instant when you   opened your heart to me like a brother and so generously accepted the gift of my shattered   heart to care for it, nurse it, and heal it.... If you forgive me, the memory of you will be   exalted by a feeling of everlasting gratitude which will never be effaced from my soul.... I   will treasure that memory: I will be true to it, I will not betray it, I will not betray my heart: it   is too constant. It returned so quickly yesterday to him to whom it has always belonged.   “We shall meet, you will come to us, you will not leave us, you will be for ever a friend, a   brother to me. And when you see me you will give me your hand ... yes? You will give it to   me, you have forgiven me, haven’t you? You love me  as before ?  “Oh, love me, do not forsake me, because I love you so at this moment, because I am worthy   of your love, because I will deserve it ... my dear! Next week I am to be married to him. He   has come back in love, he has never forgotten me. You will not be angry at my writing about   him. But I want to come and see you with him; you will like him, won’t you?   “Forgive me, remember and love your   “Nastenka.”  * * * * *  30",
    " I read that letter over and over again for a long time; tears gushed to my eyes. At last it fell   from my hands and I hid my face.   “Dearie! I say, dearie——” Matrona began.  “What is it, Matrona?”  “I have taken all the cobwebs off the ceiling; you can have a wedding or give a party.”   I looked at Matrona. She was still a hearty,  youngish  old woman, but I don’t know why all at   once I suddenly pictured her with lustreless eyes, a wrinkled face, bent, decrepit.... I don’t  know why I suddenly pictured my room grown old like Matrona. The walls and the floors   looked discoloured, everything seemed dingy; the spiders’ webs were thicker than ever. I   don’t know why, but when I looked out of the window it seemed to me that the house   opposite had grown old and dingy too, that the stucco on the columns was peeling off and   crumbling, that the cornices were cracked and blackened, and that the walls, of a vivid deep   yellow, were patchy.   Either the sunbeams suddenly peeping out from the clouds for a moment were hidden again   behind a veil of rain, and everything had grown dingy again before my eyes; or perhaps the   whole vista of my future flashed before me so sad and forbidding, and I saw myself just as I  was now, fifteen years hence, older, in the same room, just as solitary, with the same Matrona   grown no cleverer for those fifteen years.  But to imagine that I should bear you a grudge, Nastenka! That I should cast a dark cloud   over your serene, untroubled happiness; that by my bitter reproaches I should cause distress   to your heart, should poison it with secret remorse and should force it to throb with anguish at   the moment of bliss; that I should crush a single one of those tender blossoms which you   have twined in your dark tresses when you go with him to the altar.... Oh never, never! May   your sky be clear, may your sweet smile be bright and untroubled, and may you be blessed   for that moment of blissful happiness which you gave to another, lonely and grateful heart!   My God, a whole moment of happiness! Is that too little for the whole of a man’s life?  31"
